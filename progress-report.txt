## AI-Nexus V10.1 - Final Bugfix & Stability

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This report marks a major milestone: the project is now considered **Production Ready**. A final critical bug preventing the model details modal from opening on dynamically generated search results has been fixed using a robust event delegation pattern. The codebase is stable, feature-complete, and all known issues have been resolved.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Critical Bug Fix:** Resolved an issue where the "View Details" button was unresponsive on search results. The fix involved implementing event delegation to handle clicks on dynamically added elements, ensuring consistent behavior across the site.
*   **Feature Complete:** All core features outlined in the project blueprint are now implemented and stable, including:
    *   Automated data fetching, filtering, and archiving.
    *   A pure static-site architecture for maximum performance and reliability.
    *   A client-side search functionality.
    *   An interactive modal for viewing model details.
    *   AdSense compliance measures (NSFW filtering, compliance page).

*   **Stable Foundation:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   A robust data pipeline with content enrichment, archiving, and AdSense compliance filtering.
    *   Enhanced SEO with Open Graph tags.

**Current Status:**

The project is fully functional, stable, and ready for public launch and submission to advertising networks. The CI/CD pipeline is operating flawlessly.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Ad Integration:** With ad slots already in place, the next step is to sign up for an ad network (like Google AdSense), get the ad code snippets, and paste them into the designated slots in the layout files.
2.  **Update `ads.txt`:** Once approved by an ad network, update the `public/ads.txt` file with the provided authorization line.
3.  **Launch & Promotion:** Begin promoting the site on relevant social media channels and developer forums to start building an audience.
