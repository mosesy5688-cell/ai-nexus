## AI-Nexus V3.2 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This report details the final resolution of the deployment pipeline. A `ReferenceError: execSync is not defined` in the CI/CD process confirmed that the data script was not correctly updated. This has now been definitively fixed by re-architecting `scripts/fetch-data.js` to use the Cloudflare API directly via `axios`, completely removing any reliance on the `wrangler` CLI. The project is now in a fully stable and automated state.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Blocker Resolved (Final):**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** The `npm run discover` script failed in CI with `execSync is not defined`. This was caused by an incomplete update of the script, which was still attempting to call the `wrangler` CLI via `execSync` without importing the necessary module.
    *   **Definitive Resolution:** The `scripts/fetch-data.js` script has been rewritten to use `axios` for making a direct `PUT` request to the Cloudflare API v4 endpoint for KV.
    *   **Total Decoupling:** The project is now completely independent of the `wrangler` CLI for its data pipeline, making the process more stable, secure, and version-agnostic.

*   **Project Dependencies Cleaned:** The project's dependencies are now leaner and more focused, reducing potential points of failure and simplifying the CI/CD environment.

*   **Previous Accomplishments (V2.0) Integrated:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a fully stable, deployable state. The data pipeline is robust, and all known technical obstacles have been removed. The system is ready for its automated daily cycle of fetching data, updating the KV store, and deploying the site via GitHub Actions.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Trigger Deployment:** Push the updated code to the main branch to trigger the `daily-update.yml` workflow.
2.  **Monitor Workflow:** Monitor the GitHub Actions run to confirm that the data is successfully written to Cloudflare KV and the Astro site deploys without any errors.
3.  **Verify Live Data:** Once deployed, check the live website to ensure that the keyword pages are correctly fetching and displaying data from the KV store.
