## AI-Nexus V3.4 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This report details the final resolution of the deployment pipeline. A CI/CD build failure (`Unexpected "{"`) was traced back to an incorrect function call in `scripts/fetch-data.js`. This caused the script to fail, preventing the creation of `public/models.json`, which in turn caused the Astro build to fail during module parsing. This has now been definitively fixed by correcting the script's logic and completely removing all legacy `wrangler` dependencies. The project is now in a fully stable and automated state.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Blocker Resolved (Final):**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** The `astro build` process failed with an `Unexpected "{"` error because `scripts/fetch-data.js` was failing silently due to incorrect function arguments, which prevented `public/models.json` from being generated.
    *   **Definitive Resolution:** The `scripts/fetch-data.js` script has been fully corrected to use `axios` with the proper function signature for writing to Cloudflare KV.
    *   **Total Decoupling:** The project is now completely independent of the `wrangler` CLI for its data pipeline, making the process more stable, secure, and version-agnostic.

*   **Project Dependencies Cleaned:** The project's dependencies are now leaner and more focused. The unnecessary `devDependencies` for `@cloudflare/wrangler` and `@cloudflare/workers-types` have been removed from `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

*   **Previous Accomplishments (V2.0) Integrated:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   Robust data fetching logic in `src/lib/data.ts` that handles both build-time (local JSON) and runtime (Cloudflare KV) scenarios.

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a fully stable, deployable state. The data pipeline is robust, and all known technical obstacles have been removed. The system is ready for its automated daily cycle of fetching data, updating the KV store, and deploying the site via GitHub Actions.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Trigger Deployment:** Push the updated code to the main branch to trigger the `daily-update.yml` workflow.
2.  **Monitor Workflow:** Monitor the GitHub Actions run to confirm that the data is successfully written to Cloudflare KV and the Astro site deploys without any errors.
3.  **Verify Live Data:** Once deployed, check the live website to ensure that the keyword pages are correctly fetching and displaying data from the KV store.
