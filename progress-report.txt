## Major Blockers Encountered
- **Data Source Stability Risk**: Early project reliance on third-party APIs and web scraping (Puppeteer+OCR) presented uncertainties. Changes in APIs or adjustments to target website structures could interrupt the data pipeline.
  *Mitigation Strategy*: Shifted to using more stable, zero-cost official APIs and project-maintained curated lists as core data sources.
- **SEO and Content Strategy Risk**: A strategy of daily automatic generation of a large number (200+) of pages could be perceived by search engines as low-quality or programmatic spam content, leading to domain penalties.
  *Mitigation Strategy*: Adopted a Quality and Authority first strategy, focusing content creation on 3-5 core keyword deep-dive pages.
- **Monetization Strategy Risk**: Overly optimistic expectations for ad CPM ($25+) and early revenue (day two $50+) were identified. Additionally, using multiple ad networks concurrently could lead to technical conflicts and risks of being banned by platforms like AdSense.
  *Mitigation Strategy*: Strictly limited the monetization strategy to 100% Google AdSense compliance, ensuring legality and long-term stability.
