## AI-Nexus V9.4 - Search Functionality

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This phase introduces a key user-facing feature: a client-side search functionality. A new, reusable search component has been created, allowing users to instantly search across all models directly from the homepage. This significantly improves the site's usability and discoverability of content.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Client-Side Search Implemented:**
    *   A new `src/components/Search.astro` component has been created, encapsulating the search input, results display, and all related JavaScript logic.
    *   The script efficiently fetches `public/models.json` on the first search interaction and performs instant filtering on the client side.
    *   A debounce function is used to optimize performance by limiting how often the search runs as the user types.
*   **Homepage Integration:** The new search component has been added to the homepage, providing a central and accessible point for users to begin their discovery.

*   **Stable Foundation:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   A robust data pipeline with content enrichment, archiving, and AdSense compliance filtering.
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).

**Current Status:**

The project now has a powerful search feature, making it a more effective tool for users. The codebase remains clean, modular, and stable.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Ad Integration:** With ad slots already in place, the next step is to sign up for an ad network (like Google AdSense), get the ad code snippets, and paste them into the designated slots in the layout files.
2.  **Update `ads.txt`:** Once approved by an ad network, update the `public/ads.txt` file with the provided authorization line.
3.  **UI/UX Enhancements:** Further refine the display of search results and consider adding sorting or advanced filtering options.
