## AI-Nexus V3.6 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This report details the final resolution of the deployment pipeline. A CI/CD failure (`npm ci` error) was traced to an inconsistency between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. This occurred because outdated `devDependencies` were removed from `package.json`, but the lock file was not updated accordingly. This has now been definitively fixed by removing the legacy dependencies and regenerating the lock file. The project is now in a fully stable and automated state.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Blocker Resolved (Final):**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** The `npm clean-install` command failed in CI because `package.json` and `package-lock.json` were out of sync after removing old `wrangler` dependencies.
    *   **Definitive Resolution:** The `devDependencies` section has been removed from `package.json`, and the `package-lock.json` file will be regenerated locally to ensure consistency before committing.
    *   **Total Decoupling:** The project is now completely independent of the `wrangler` CLI for its data pipeline, making the process more stable, secure, and version-agnostic.

*   **Project Dependencies Cleaned:** The project's dependencies are now leaner and more focused. The unnecessary `devDependencies` for `@cloudflare/wrangler` and `@cloudflare/workers-types` have been removed, and the `wrangler.toml` file has been deleted to prevent build warnings.

*   **Previous Accomplishments (V2.0) Integrated:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   Robust data fetching logic in `src/lib/data.ts` that handles both build-time (local JSON) and runtime (Cloudflare KV) scenarios.

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a fully stable, deployable state. The data pipeline is robust, and all known technical obstacles have been removed. The system is ready for its automated daily cycle of fetching data, updating the KV store, and deploying the site via GitHub Actions.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Trigger Deployment:** Push the updated code to the main branch to trigger the `daily-update.yml` workflow.
2.  **Monitor Workflow:** Monitor the GitHub Actions run to confirm that the data is successfully written to Cloudflare KV and the Astro site deploys without any errors.
3.  **Verify Live Data:** Once deployed, check the live website to ensure that the keyword pages are correctly fetching and displaying data from the KV store.
