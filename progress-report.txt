## AI-Nexus V9.3 - AdSense Compliance & Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This phase focuses on a critical review and implementation of changes to ensure Google AdSense compliance. The primary issue of potential NSFW content has been addressed by implementing an automated filtering system in the data pipeline. Additionally, ad slots have been refactored into a reusable component for better maintainability.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **AdSense Compliance:**
    *   **NSFW Content Filtering:** The `scripts/fetch-data.js` script has been updated with a filtering mechanism to automatically remove any models whose name, description, or tags contain prohibited keywords (e.g., 'nsfw', 'porn', 'explicit'). This is a crucial step for AdSense approval.
    *   **Required Pages & Files:** The project structure includes a Privacy Policy (`privacy.astro`) and an `ads.txt` file, which are essential for compliance.
*   **Ad Slot Refactoring:** Ad placements have been refactored into a reusable `src/components/AdSlot.astro` component, simplifying future ad code management.

*   **Stable Foundation:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   A robust data pipeline with content enrichment and archiving capabilities.
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a much stronger position for AdSense approval. The automated content filtering provides a critical safeguard against policy violations.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Ad Integration:** With ad slots already in place, the next step is to sign up for an ad network (like Google AdSense), get the ad code snippets, and paste them into the designated slots in the layout files.
2.  **Update `ads.txt`:** Once approved by an ad network, update the `public/ads.txt` file with the provided authorization line.
3.  **Implement Community Features:** Begin work on the planned user reviews and discussion forum, ensuring a robust moderation plan is in place before launch to maintain compliance.
