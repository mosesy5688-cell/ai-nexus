## AI-Nexus V9.6 - Content Population & Logic Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This phase focuses on populating the website with content by resolving the core issue of data-to-page matching. A more flexible and robust keyword matching system has been implemented, allowing models from various sources to be correctly categorized and displayed on their respective keyword pages.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Content Populated:** The website's keyword pages are now correctly displaying relevant AI models. This was achieved by:
    *   **Enhanced Keyword Matching:** The `CORE_KEYWORDS` configuration in `src/content/config.ts` was updated to include a `matchTerms` array, defining all relevant data tags and tasks for each category.
    *   **Updated Page Logic:** The dynamic pages (`[keyword].astro` and `[[slug]].astro`) were updated to use this new `matchTerms` array for filtering, ensuring a correct and comprehensive list of models is displayed.

*   **Stable Foundation:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   A robust data pipeline with content enrichment, archiving, and AdSense compliance filtering.
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   A reusable, client-side search component is in place.

**Current Status:**

The project is now a content-rich, functional website. The core architecture is stable, and the automated content pipeline is working as intended.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Ad Integration:** With ad slots already in place, the next step is to sign up for an ad network (like Google AdSense), get the ad code snippets, and paste them into the designated slots in the layout files.
2.  **Update `ads.txt`:** Once approved by an ad network, update the `public/ads.txt` file with the provided authorization line.
3.  **UI/UX Enhancements:** Further refine the display of search results and consider adding sorting or advanced filtering options.
