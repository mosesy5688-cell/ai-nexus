## AI-Nexus V9.0 - Stable Deployment

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

**Project deployment is now fully successful and stable!** All blockers, from dependency conflicts and build errors to architectural issues, have been resolved. The pure Static Site Generation (SSG) architecture has proven to be robust and reliable. The CI/CD pipeline is operating as expected, automatically fetching data and deploying the site.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Success:** The `daily-update.yml` workflow now completes all steps successfully, including data fetching, building, and deploying to Cloudflare Pages.
*   **Stable Architecture:** The pure Static Site Generation (SSG) approach (`output: 'static'`) has eliminated all build-time vs. runtime conflicts, ensuring a reliable and predictable build process.
*   **Clean Dependencies:** The project is free of legacy dependencies and known vulnerabilities, with a streamlined and maintainable `package.json`.

*   **Integrated Features:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   A simplified and robust static data fetching architecture.

**Current Status:**

The project is live and fully operational. The core automated data pipeline and deployment system are complete. The foundation is solid and ready for future feature development.

**Next Steps:**

With the infrastructure now stable, focus can shift to enhancing the user-facing features and content.

1.  **Enhance UI/UX:** Improve the presentation of model data on the keyword pages by creating dedicated components.
2.  **Expand Data Sources:** Integrate additional data sources beyond Hugging Face (e.g., Civitai) to enrich the content.
3.  **Implement Community Features:** Begin work on the planned user reviews and discussion forum as outlined in the project blueprint.
