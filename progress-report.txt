## AI-Nexus V9.9 - Final Polish & SEO Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This phase completes the final pre-launch polish. The "About" page has been rewritten to be more compelling and informative. Unnecessary legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) have been removed to streamline the site, and global SEO has been enhanced with the addition of Open Graph and Twitter card meta tags.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Content Optimization:** The `about.astro` page content has been completely overhauled to better explain the project's mission, architecture, and philosophy.
*   **Site Cleanup:** Removed the empty `privacy.astro` and `terms.astro` pages and their corresponding links in the footer, simplifying site navigation.
*   **Global SEO Enhancement:** Added Open Graph (`og:`) and Twitter (`twitter:`) meta tags to the main `Layout.astro`. This will ensure rich, attractive previews when the site's pages are shared on social media platforms.

*   **Stable Foundation:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   A robust data pipeline with content enrichment, archiving, and AdSense compliance filtering.
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).

**Current Status:**

The project is now content-complete, structurally clean, and SEO-optimized. It is in an excellent state for a public launch and for submission to advertising networks.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Ad Integration:** With ad slots already in place, the next step is to sign up for an ad network (like Google AdSense), get the ad code snippets, and paste them into the designated slots in the layout files.
2.  **Update `ads.txt`:** Once approved by an ad network, update the `public/ads.txt` file with the provided authorization line.
3.  **Launch & Promotion:** Begin promoting the site on relevant social media channels and developer forums.
