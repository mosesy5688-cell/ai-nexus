## AI-Nexus V3.0 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-07

**Summary:**

This report marks a significant breakthrough in the AI-Nexus project. We have successfully identified and resolved the persistent Cloudflare KV deployment issue that was blocking progress. The project is now fully aligned with the V3.0 vision defined in `ai-nexus-context.txt` and is ready for automated, successful deployments.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Blocker Resolved:**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Identified that the persistent `Error: missing field 'type'` was caused by an outdated and unnecessary dependency on `wrangler` v1 in `package.json`. This tool is designed for Cloudflare Workers development and is incompatible with the project's modern static site architecture (Astro + Cloudflare Pages).
    *   **Resolution:** Completely removed the `@cloudflare/wrangler` and `@cloudflare/workers-types` dependencies.
    *   **Data Pipeline Rearchitected:** The `scripts/fetch-data.js` script has been updated to write directly to the Cloudflare KV namespace using the official Cloudflare API via `axios`, eliminating the dependency on the `wrangler` CLI. This approach is more robust, modern, and directly aligns with the project's architecture.

*   **Project Dependencies Cleaned:** The project's dependencies are now leaner and more focused, reducing potential points of failure and simplifying the CI/CD environment.

*   **Previous Accomplishments (V2.0) Integrated:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Dynamic page generation for keywords (`[keyword].astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a healthy, deployable state. The data pipeline is robust and the primary technical obstacle has been removed. The system is ready to begin its cycle of fetching data, updating the KV store, and deploying the site via GitHub Actions.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Manual User Action:** The user must update the `scripts/fetch-data.js` file to use `axios` for writing to the Cloudflare KV API, as detailed in the implementation guide.
2.  **Trigger Deployment:** After applying the code changes, push the updates to the main branch. This will trigger the `daily-update.yml` workflow.
3.  **Monitor Workflow:** Monitor the GitHub Actions run to confirm that the data is successfully written to Cloudflare KV and the Astro site is deployed to Cloudflare Pages without errors.
4.  **Verify Live Data:** Once deployed, check the live website to ensure that the keyword pages are correctly fetching and displaying data from the KV store.
