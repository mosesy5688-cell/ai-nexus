## AI-Nexus V2.0 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-06

**Summary:**

This report outlines the significant progress made in aligning the AI-Nexus project with the V2.0 vision defined in `ai-nexus-context.txt`. The focus has been on improving the website's structure, design, and content, as well as implementing a robust data pipeline using Cloudflare KV.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Website Redesign:**
    *   Implemented a new, modern, and professional design for the entire website.
    *   Updated the layout (`Layout.astro`) to include a header, footer, and improved typography.
    *   Created a new color scheme and defined it in `base.css`.
    *   Redesigned the homepage (`index.astro`) to be more engaging and to highlight the core keyword categories.

*   **Content Structure & Enrichment:**
    *   Restructured the dynamic pages from `[[slug]].astro` to `[keyword].astro` to better align with the project's vision.
    *   Created a dedicated `KeywordPageLayout.astro` to serve as a template for keyword pages.
    *   Added a FAQ section to the keyword pages to provide more in-depth, authoritative content.
    *   Created a `faq.json` file to store the FAQ data.

*   **SEO Improvements:**
    *   Created a `schema.ts` file to generate JSON-LD schemas for the keyword pages.
    *   Added the schema to the `KeywordPageLayout.astro` file to improve search engine visibility.

*   **Data Pipeline & Cloudflare KV Integration:**
    *   Updated the `fetch-data.js` script to write the fetched data to Cloudflare KV in a CI environment.
    *   Modified the `data.ts` file to fetch data from Cloudflare KV in a production environment, with a fallback to a local JSON file for development.
    *   Installed the necessary Cloudflare dependencies (`@cloudflare/workers-types`, `@cloudflare/wrangler`).

*   **Automation:**
    *   Renamed the deployment workflow to `daily-update.yml`.
    *   Updated the workflow to run the `discover` script before building the application, ensuring that the data is always up-to-date.
    *   Configured the workflow to run on a daily schedule, as defined in the project plan.

*   **New Pages:**
    *   Created `about.astro`, `privacy.astro`, and `terms.astro` pages.

**Current Status:**

The project is now technically ready for deployment to Cloudflare Pages with Cloudflare KV integration.

**Next Steps (User Action Required):**

To successfully deploy the project, the following critical steps need to be performed by the user:

1.  **Cloudflare Account Setup:** Ensure a Cloudflare account is set up.
2.  **Cloudflare Pages Project:** Create a Cloudflare Pages project for AI-Nexus.
3.  **Cloudflare KV Namespace:** Create a Cloudflare KV namespace (e.g., `AI_NEXUS_KV`).
4.  **GitHub Secrets Configuration:** Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:
    *   `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: A Cloudflare API token with permissions to manage Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare KV.
    *   `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID.
    *   `CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME`: The name of your Cloudflare Pages project (e.g., `ai-nexus`).
    *   `KV_NAMESPACE_ID`: The ID of your Cloudflare KV namespace.

Once these secrets are configured, the `daily-update.yml` GitHub Actions workflow will automatically handle data fetching, KV storage, application building, and deployment to Cloudflare Pages.
