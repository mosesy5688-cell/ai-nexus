## AI-Nexus V11.0 - Final Interaction & Content Fix

**Date:** 2025-11-09

**Summary:**

This report marks a major stability milestone. After a thorough review, all outstanding interaction bugs and content-matching issues have been definitively resolved. The project has been refactored to use a simple, robust, and reliable pure-link navigation system, removing all complex client-side scripting for core navigation.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **"View Details" Bug Fixed:** The issue of model cards linking to the homepage has been resolved. The `ModelCard.astro` component is now a direct link to the correct model detail page. All conflicting client-side modal logic has been removed from `KeywordPageLayout.astro`.
*   **Content Population Fixed:** The `matchTerms` in `src/content/config.ts` have been expanded, ensuring that all keyword pages, including "Code Synthesis" and "Machine Translation," are now correctly populated with relevant models.
*   **Homepage Layout Fixed:** Incorrect links on the homepage's keyword cards have been corrected to point to their respective category pages.

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a truly stable, predictable, and production-ready state. All core functionalities are working as designed, and the codebase is cleaner and more maintainable.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Ad Integration:** The site is fully prepared for an AdSense application and ad code integration.
2.  **Update `ads.txt`:** Once approved by an ad network, update the `public/ads.txt` file with the provided authorization line.
3.  **Launch & Promotion:** Begin promoting the site on relevant social media channels and developer forums to start building an audience.
