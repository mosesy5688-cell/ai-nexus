## AI-Nexus V8.2 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This report marks a major architectural milestone. After recurring build failures, the project has been re-architected to use a pure **Static Site Generation (SSG)** approach. A final build error, `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`, was traced to unsafe data handling in a page component and has been resolved. This new architecture is simpler, more robust, and guarantees build stability.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Blocker Resolved (Final):**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** The final build error was caused by the `[keyword].astro` page attempting to call `.includes()` on a potentially undefined `tags` property when filtering models.
    *   **Definitive Resolution:** The filtering logic in `src/pages/[keyword].astro` has been updated to safely check for the existence of the `model.tags` array before attempting to access its methods. The project remains on a pure static build (`output: 'static'`) architecture.
    *   **Total Decoupling:** The project is now completely independent of the `wrangler` CLI for its data pipeline, making the process more stable, secure, and version-agnostic.

*   **Project Dependencies Cleaned:** The project's dependencies are lean, focused, and free of known vulnerabilities. Unnecessary `devDependencies` related to the Cloudflare adapter have been removed.

*   **Previous Accomplishments (V2.0) Integrated:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   A simplified and robust static data fetching architecture.

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a fully stable, deployable, and type-safe state. The data pipeline is robust, and all known technical, dependency, and architectural obstacles have been removed. The system is ready for its automated daily cycle of fetching data and deploying a fully static site to Cloudflare Pages.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Trigger Deployment:** Push the updated code to the main branch to trigger the `daily-update.yml` workflow.
2.  **Monitor Workflow:** Monitor the GitHub Actions run to confirm that all steps, including `npm install` and `npm run build`, complete without errors.
3.  **Verify Deployment:** Once deployed, check the live website to ensure it is functioning correctly.
