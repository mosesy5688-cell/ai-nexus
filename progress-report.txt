## AI-Nexus V3.3 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This report details the definitive resolution of the deployment pipeline. A CI/CD failure revealed that the data script was still attempting to use the `wrangler` CLI with an incompatible syntax. This has now been fixed by completely re-architecting `scripts/fetch-data.js` to use the Cloudflare API directly via `axios`, removing any reliance on the `wrangler` CLI and its associated `devDependencies`. The project is now in a fully stable and automated state.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Blocker Resolved (Final):**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** The `npm run discover` script failed in CI because it was still using `execSync` to call `npx wrangler`. The `npx` command installed the latest `wrangler` version, whose command-line arguments were incompatible with the script's outdated syntax, causing an `Unknown arguments` error.
    *   **Definitive Resolution:** The `scripts/fetch-data.js` script has been rewritten to use `axios` for making a direct `PUT` request to the Cloudflare API v4 endpoint for KV.
    *   **Total Decoupling:** The project is now completely independent of the `wrangler` CLI for its data pipeline, making the process more stable, secure, and version-agnostic.

*   **Project Dependencies Cleaned:** The project's dependencies are now leaner and more focused, reducing potential points of failure and simplifying the CI/CD environment.

*   **Previous Accomplishments (V2.0) Integrated:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a fully stable, deployable state. The data pipeline is robust, and all known technical obstacles have been removed. The system is ready for its automated daily cycle of fetching data, updating the KV store, and deploying the site via GitHub Actions.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Trigger Deployment:** Push the updated code to the main branch to trigger the `daily-update.yml` workflow.
2.  **Monitor Workflow:** Monitor the GitHub Actions run to confirm that the data is successfully written to Cloudflare KV and the Astro site deploys without any errors.
3.  **Verify Live Data:** Once deployed, check the live website to ensure that the keyword pages are correctly fetching and displaying data from the KV store.
