## AI-Nexus V12.0 - Architecture Refactor: Pure Static

**Date:** 2025-11-09

**Summary:**

This report marks a major architectural overhaul to achieve maximum stability and performance. All outstanding navigation bugs and content-matching issues have been definitively resolved by refactoring the entire site to a **100% pure static architecture**. Complex client-side JavaScript for navigation has been eliminated in favor of simple, reliable HTML links, and dedicated static detail pages are now generated for every model.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Static Detail Pages:** Implemented a new dynamic route `src/pages/model/[...slug].astro` that generates a unique, static HTML page for every AI model at build time. This is the most stable and SEO-friendly approach.
*   **"View Details" Bug Fixed:** The `ModelCard.astro` component has been refactored into a simple `<a>` tag that links directly to the new static detail pages. All conflicting client-side modal logic and scripts have been completely removed from `KeywordPageLayout.astro`, eliminating the root cause of all navigation bugs.
*   **Content Population Fixed:** The `matchTerms` in `src/content/config.ts` have been expanded, ensuring that all keyword pages, including "Code Synthesis" and "Machine Translation," are now correctly populated with relevant models.
*   **Homepage Layout Fixed:** Incorrect links on the homepage's keyword cards have been corrected to point to their respective category pages.
*   **Sitemap Generation:** The `astro.config.mjs` is now correctly configured to automatically generate a complete `sitemap.xml` that includes all static pages, including the newly created model detail pages.

**Current Status:**

The project is now in its most stable, performant, and maintainable state yet. The pure static architecture eliminates a whole class of potential bugs and provides the best possible user experience and SEO foundation.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Ad Integration:** The site is fully prepared for an AdSense application and ad code integration.
2.  **Update `ads.txt`:** Once approved by an ad network, update the `public/ads.txt` file with the provided authorization line.
3.  **Launch & Promotion:** Begin promoting the site on relevant social media channels and developer forums to start building an audience.
