## AI-Nexus V7.0 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This report marks a major architectural milestone. After recurring build failures with `hybrid` mode, the project has been re-architected to use a pure **Static Site Generation (SSG)** approach (`output: 'static'`). This definitively resolves all build-time vs. runtime conflicts by ensuring the build process relies solely on a local data file (`public/models.json`), which is generated just-in-time by the CI/CD workflow. This new architecture is simpler, more robust, and guarantees build stability.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Blocker Resolved (Final):**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Recurring build failures were caused by the instability of `hybrid` mode in the CI environment and the complexity of distinguishing build-time from edge-runtime data fetching.
    *   **Definitive Resolution:** The project has been switched to `output: 'static'` in `astro.config.mjs`. The `getModels` function in `src/lib/data.ts` has been simplified to **only** read from the local `public/models.json` file, completely removing all runtime-specific logic (like accessing `Astro.locals`) from the build path.
    *   **Total Decoupling:** The project is now completely independent of the `wrangler` CLI for its data pipeline, making the process more stable, secure, and version-agnostic.

*   **Project Dependencies Cleaned:** The project's dependencies are lean, focused, and free of known vulnerabilities.

*   **Previous Accomplishments (V2.0) Integrated:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   A simplified and robust data fetching architecture.

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a fully stable, deployable, and type-safe state. The data pipeline is robust, and all known technical, dependency, and architectural obstacles have been removed. The system is ready for its automated daily cycle of fetching data and deploying a fully static site to Cloudflare Pages.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Trigger Deployment:** Push the updated code to the main branch to trigger the `daily-update.yml` workflow.
2.  **Monitor Workflow:** Monitor the GitHub Actions run to confirm that all steps, including `npm install` and `npm run build`, complete without errors.
3.  **Verify Deployment:** Once deployed, check the live website to ensure it is functioning correctly.
