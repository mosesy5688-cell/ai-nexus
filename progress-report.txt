## AI-Nexus V9.5 - Search Integration Fix

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This phase addresses a build failure caused by a syntax error in the homepage file (`index.astro`) after the initial integration of the new search component. The file structure has been corrected, and the search component is now properly imported and rendered.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Build Error Resolved:** Fixed a `Search is not defined` error by correcting the file structure of `src/pages/index.astro`. The duplicate frontmatter and layout components were removed, and the `Search` component is now correctly imported.
*   **Search Feature Stable:** The client-side search functionality is now correctly integrated into the homepage, providing a central and accessible point for users to begin their discovery.

*   **Stable Foundation:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   A robust data pipeline with content enrichment, archiving, and AdSense compliance filtering.
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   A reusable, client-side search component.

**Current Status:**

The project is once again in a stable, deployable state. The search feature is correctly implemented, and the codebase remains clean and modular.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Ad Integration:** With ad slots already in place, the next step is to sign up for an ad network (like Google AdSense), get the ad code snippets, and paste them into the designated slots in the layout files.
2.  **Update `ads.txt`:** Once approved by an ad network, update the `public/ads.txt` file with the provided authorization line.
3.  **UI/UX Enhancements:** Refine the display of search results, potentially by reusing the `ModelCard.astro` component for a richer presentation.
