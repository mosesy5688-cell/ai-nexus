## AI-Nexus V9.8 - Compliance Statement

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

To strengthen the site's position for advertising approval and build user trust, a dedicated Compliance & Content Policy page has been created. This page transparently communicates the site's commitment to safety, its automated NSFW content filtering mechanisms, and its adherence to advertising network policies.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Compliance Page Created:** A new page at `/compliance` has been added, detailing the site's content policies, including the automated filtering of adult content.
*   **Footer Link Added:** The new compliance page is now accessible via a link in the website's global footer, ensuring transparency for all users and reviewers.
*   **Strengthened AdSense Case:** By proactively and clearly stating its compliance efforts, the project significantly improves its chances of a successful Google AdSense application.

*   **Stable Foundation:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   A robust data pipeline with content enrichment, archiving, and AdSense compliance filtering.
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   Interactive UI features like search and model-details modals.

**Current Status:**

The project now includes all essential legal and policy pages required for a professional, ad-supported website. The codebase is stable and feature-rich.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Ad Integration:** With ad slots already in place, the next step is to sign up for an ad network (like Google AdSense), get the ad code snippets, and paste them into the designated slots in the layout files.
2.  **Update `ads.txt`:** Once approved by an ad network, update the `public/ads.txt` file with the provided authorization line.
3.  **Final Content Review:** Perform a final review of all pages to ensure content quality and consistency before submitting for AdSense review.
