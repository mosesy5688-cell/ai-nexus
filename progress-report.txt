## AI-Nexus V9.1 - Code Refactoring & Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

With the deployment pipeline stable, this phase focuses on improving code quality and maintainability. Key optimizations include refactoring the UI into a dedicated `ModelCard` component and making the data loading logic more robust and scalable. Unused data files have been cleaned up to streamline the project structure.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **UI Refactoring:** The model display logic has been extracted from `KeywordPageLayout.astro` into a new, reusable `src/components/ModelCard.astro` component. This simplifies the layout file and improves component modularity.
*   **Data Logic Optimization:** The `getToolsForKeyword` function in `src/lib/data.ts` has been rewritten to dynamically import data files based on the keyword, making it more scalable. The `getModels` function signature was also simplified.
*   **File Cleanup:** Removed unused JSON files (`resume.json`, `video.json`, `writing.json`) from the `src/content/auto/` directory, resulting in a cleaner and more focused project structure.

*   **Stable Foundation:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   A simplified and robust static data fetching architecture.

**Current Status:**

The project's codebase is now cleaner, more modular, and better prepared for future expansion. The stable CI/CD pipeline remains fully operational.

**Next Steps:**

With the codebase now optimized, focus can shift to enhancing the user-facing features and content.

1.  **Expand Data Sources:** Integrate additional data sources beyond Hugging Face (e.g., Civitai) to enrich the content.
2.  **Implement Community Features:** Begin work on the planned user reviews and discussion forum as outlined in the project blueprint.
3.  **Content Population:** Begin adding more curated tool data and FAQ content.
