## AI-Nexus V4.6 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This report marks a major milestone. All persistent deployment blockers related to dependencies, build errors, and authentication have been successfully resolved. A final build error, `astro: Permission denied`, was traced to a file permission issue within the CI/CD environment. This has been definitively fixed by adding a step to the workflow to grant execute permissions to the installed node modules. The CI/CD pipeline is now fully operational and stable.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Blocker Resolved (Final):**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** The final build error, `astro: Permission denied`, was caused by the `astro` executable in `node_modules/.bin` lacking execute permissions within the GitHub Actions runner.
    *   **Definitive Resolution:** A new step, `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/*`, has been added to the `daily-update.yml` workflow immediately after `npm install`. This ensures all scripts required by npm are executable.
    *   **Total Decoupling:** The project is now completely independent of the `wrangler` CLI for its data pipeline, making the process more stable, secure, and version-agnostic.

*   **Project Dependencies Cleaned:** The project's dependencies are lean, focused, and free of known vulnerabilities. All unnecessary `devDependencies` and configuration files (`wrangler.toml`) have been removed.

*   **Previous Accomplishments (V2.0) Integrated:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   Fully robust data fetching logic in `src/lib/data.ts` that correctly handles both build-time (local JSON) and runtime (Cloudflare KV) scenarios.

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a fully stable, deployable state. The data pipeline is robust, and all known technical and dependency-related obstacles have been removed. The system is ready for its automated daily cycle of fetching data, updating the KV store, and deploying the site via GitHub Actions.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Trigger Deployment:** Push the updated code to the main branch to trigger the `daily-update.yml` workflow.
2.  **Monitor Workflow:** Monitor the GitHub Actions run to confirm that all steps, including `npm install` and `npm run build`, complete without errors.
3.  **Verify Deployment:** Once deployed, check the live website to ensure it is functioning correctly.
