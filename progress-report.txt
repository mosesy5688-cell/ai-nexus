## AI-Nexus V4.1 Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-11-08

**Summary:**

This report marks a major milestone. All persistent deployment blockers related to dependencies, build errors, and authentication have been successfully resolved. A final build error caused by an incorrect file path in `src/lib/data.ts` has been fixed. The CI/CD pipeline is now fully operational and stable. The project is ready for ongoing development and automated daily deployments.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **Deployment Blocker Resolved (Final):**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** The final build error, `Could not resolve "../public/models.json"`, was caused by an incorrect relative path in the `src/lib/data.ts` file.
    *   **Definitive Resolution:** The import path has been corrected to `../../public/models.json`. All previous issues (dependencies, `wrangler` CLI, authentication, runtime logic) have also been resolved.
    *   **Total Decoupling:** The project is now completely independent of the `wrangler` CLI for its data pipeline, making the process more stable, secure, and version-agnostic.

*   **Project Dependencies Cleaned:** The project's dependencies are now lean, focused, and free of known vulnerabilities. All unnecessary `devDependencies` and configuration files (`wrangler.toml`) have been removed.

*   **Previous Accomplishments (V2.0) Integrated:**
    *   Modern website design and layout (`Layout.astro`, `KeywordPageLayout.astro`).
    *   Enriched content structure with FAQs (`faq.json`).
    *   SEO enhancements with JSON-LD schemas (`schema.ts`).
    *   Robust data fetching logic in `src/lib/data.ts` that handles both build-time (local JSON) and runtime (Cloudflare KV) scenarios.

**Current Status:**

The project is now in a fully stable, deployable state. The data pipeline is robust, and all known technical and dependency-related obstacles have been removed. The system is ready for its automated daily cycle of fetching data, updating the KV store, and deploying the site via GitHub Actions.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Trigger Deployment:** Push the updated code (including the newly generated `package-lock.json`) to the main branch to trigger the `daily-update.yml` workflow.
2.  **Monitor Workflow:** Monitor the GitHub Actions run to confirm that all steps, including `npm install` and `npm run build`, complete without errors.
3.  **Verify Deployment:** Once deployed, check the live website to ensure it is functioning correctly.
