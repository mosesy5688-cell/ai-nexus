        <p>
          Our platform is designed to be a safe and family-friendly resource. We employ automated scripts to filter content based on keywords associated with Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) material. This includes, but is not limited to, terms related to explicit, adult, or violent content.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automated Filtering:</strong> Our scripts identify and exclude models tagged with or containing descriptions related to NSFW, explicit, or adult themes.</li>
          <li><strong>No Hosting:</strong> We do not host any models or images directly; we only link to publicly available resources on platforms like Hugging Face, GitHub, and Civitai.</li>
          <li><strong>Best-Effort Basis:</strong> While we strive for accuracy, automated filtering may not be perfect. We are continually improving our algorithms.</li>
        </ul>
