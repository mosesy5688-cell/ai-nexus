        <p>
          Our primary goal is to provide a comprehensive and valuable resource for discovering open-source AI models. To ensure a safe browsing experience for all our users and to comply with the policies of our advertising partners, such as Google AdSense, we have implemented a strict content filtering policy.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Automated NSFW Filtering:</strong> Our data processing scripts automatically scan the names, descriptions, and tags of all models fetched from external sources (like Hugging Face and Civitai).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prohibited Content:</strong> Any model that contains keywords related to adult, explicit, or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content is automatically excluded from our website's listings. We maintain a zero-tolerance policy for sexually explicit material.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ongoing Monitoring:</strong> We continuously update our filtering mechanisms to adapt to new data and ensure our platform remains clean and compliant.
          </li>
