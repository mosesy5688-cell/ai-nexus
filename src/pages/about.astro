        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">What is Free AI Tools?</h2>
        <p>
          Free AI Tools is an ambitious, fully automated platform designed for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts. In a landscape that changes daily, finding the right open-source model can be a challenge. We solve this by programmatically discovering, categorizing, and indexing the most popular and impactful AI models from leading platforms like Hugging Face and Civitai.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our entire system, from data fetching to content generation, runs on a zero-cost, serverless architecture, demonstrating the power of modern cloud infrastructure.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Our automated CI/CD pipeline, powered by GitHub Actions, runs daily to ensure our content is always fresh:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Discover:</strong> A script fetches the latest and most-liked models from various public APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>Filter & Sanitize:</strong> We automatically filter out any potentially unsafe or NSFW content to maintain a compliant and family-safe environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Categorize:</strong> Models are intelligently sorted into relevant categories like <a href={`/keyword/${CORE_KEYWORDS[0].slug}/`}>{CORE_KEYWORDS[0].title}</a> and <a href={`/keyword/${CORE_KEYWORDS[1].slug}/`}>{CORE_KEYWORDS[1].title}</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Deploy:</strong> The updated, content-rich site is built and deployed globally via Cloudflare Pages, ensuring lightning-fast access for everyone.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Our Philosophy</h2>
