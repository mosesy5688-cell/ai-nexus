# AI Fundamentals

Welcome to the foundational core of the AI Knowledge Mesh. This entry serves as a bridge for the most common technical concepts in machine learning and neural networks.

## Core Concepts

Understanding modern AI requires a grasp of several key pillars:

### 1. Neural Networks
The mathematical backbone inspired by biological neurons. At its simplest, it involves layers of parameters (weights and biases) that transform data to identify patterns.

### 2. Deep Learning
The application of multi-layered neural networks to complex tasks like vision and language processing.

### 3. Machine Learning Algorithms
A broader category including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques.
