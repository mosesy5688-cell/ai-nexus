# AI Agents

AI Agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

## What Makes an Agent?

Unlike simple chatbots, AI agents have:

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Autonomy** | Can work independently without constant input |
| **Goal-Oriented** | Works toward specific objectives |
| **Tool Use** | Can interact with external systems and APIs |
| **Memory** | Maintains context across interactions |
| **Planning** | Breaks complex tasks into subtasks |

## Agent Architectures

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
The agent alternates between:
1. **Reasoning**: Thinking about what to do
2. **Acting**: Executing tools or actions
3. **Observing**: Processing results

### Plan-and-Execute
1. Create a complete plan upfront
2. Execute each step sequentially
3. Re-plan if something fails

## Popular Agent Frameworks

| Framework | Key Feature | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **AutoGPT** | Full autonomy | General tasks |
| **LangChain Agents** | Flexible tools | Custom workflows |
| **Crew AI** | Multi-agent teams | Complex projects |
| **Autogen** | Conversational | Human-in-loop |
