These feature vectors are directly fed into VITS without the need for conversion to a text-based intermediate representation. As a result, the pitch and intonations of the original audio are preserved. Meanwhile, the vocoder was replaced with [NSF HiFiGAN](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger/tree/refactor/modules/nsf_hifigan) to solve the problem of sound interruption.\n\n### 🆕 4.1-Stable Version Update Content\n\n- Feature input is changed to the 12th Layer of [Content Vec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec) Transformer output, And compatible with 4.0 branches.\n- Update the shallow diffusion, you can use the shallow diffusion model to improve the sound quality.\n- Added Whisper-PPG encoder support\n- Added static/dynamic sound fusion\n- Added loudness embedding\n- Added Functionality of feature retrieval from [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI)\n  \n### 🆕 Questions about compatibility with the 4.0 model\n\n- To support the 4.0 model and incorporate the speech encoder, you can make modifications to the `config.json` file. Add the `speech_encoder` field to the "model" section as shown below:\n\n```\n  "model": {\n    .........\n    "ssl_dim": 256,\n    "n_speakers": 200,\n    "speech_encoder":"vec256l9"\n  }\n```\n\n### 🆕 Shallow diffusion\n![Diagram](shadowdiffusion.png)\n\n## 💬 Python Version\n\nBased on our testing, we have determined that the project runs stable on `Python 3.8.9`.\n\n## 📥 Pre-trained Model Files\n\n#### **Required**\n\n**You need to select one encoder from the list below**\n\n##### **1.

It is advisable to consult with the author beforehand or carefully review the description to ascertain the permissible usage of the model. This helps ensure compliance with any specified guidelines or restrictions regarding its utilization.\n\n#### **Optional(Select as Required)**\n\n##### NSF-HIFIGAN\n\nIf you are using the `NSF-HIFIGAN enhancer` or `shallow diffusion`, you will need to download the pre-trained NSF-HIFIGAN model.\n\n- Pre-trained NSF-HIFIGAN Vocoder: [nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip](https://github.com/openvpi/vocoders/releases/download/nsf-hifigan-v1/nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip)\n  - Unzip and place the four files under the `pretrain/nsf_hifigan` directory\n\n```shell\n# nsf_hifigan\nwget -P pretrain/ https://github.com/openvpi/vocoders/releases/download/nsf-hifigan-v1/nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip\nunzip -od pretrain/nsf_hifigan pretrain/nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip\n# Alternatively, you can manually download and place it in the pretrain/nsf_hifigan directory\n# URL: https://github.com/openvpi/vocoders/releases/tag/nsf-hifigan-v1\n```\n\n##### RMVPE\n\nIf you are using the `rmvpe` F0 Predictor, you will need to download the pre-trained RMVPE model.\n\n+ download model at [rmvpe.zip](https://github.com/yxlllc/RMVPE/releases/download/230917/rmvpe.zip), this weight is recommended.\n  + unzip `rmvpe.zip`，and rename the `model.pt` file to `rmvpe.pt` and place it under the `pretrain` directory.\n\n- ~~download model at [rmvpe.pt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ylzz1997/rmvpe_pretrain_model/resolve/main/rmvpe.pt)~~\n  - ~~Place it under the `pretrain` directory~~\n\n##### FCPE(Preview version)\n\n[FCPE(Fast Context-base Pitch Estimator)](https://github.com/CNChTu/MelPE) is a dedicated F0 predictor designed for real-time voice conversion and will become the preferred F0 predictor for sovits real-time voice conversion in the future.(The paper is being written)\n\nIf you are using the `fcpe` F0 Predictor, you will need to download the pre-trained FCPE model.\n\n- download model at [fcpe.pt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ylzz1997/rmvpe_pretrain_model/resolve/main/fcpe.pt)\n  - Place it under the `pretrain` directory\n\n## 📊 Dataset Preparation\n\nSimply place the dataset in the `dataset_raw` directory with the following file structure:\n\n```\ndataset_raw\n├───speaker0\n│   ├───xxx1-xxx1.wav\n│   ├───...\n│   └───Lxx-0xx8.wav\n└───speaker1\n    ├───xx2-0xxx2.wav\n    ├───...\n    └───xxx7-xxx007.wav\n```\nThere are no specific restrictions on the format of the name for each audio file (naming conventions such as `000001.wav` to `999999.wav` are also valid), but the file type must be `WAV``.\n\nYou can customize the speaker''s name as showed below:\n\n```\ndataset_raw\n└───suijiSUI\n    ├───1.wav\n    ├───...\n    └───25788785-20221210-200143-856_01_(Vocals)_0_0.wav\n```\n\n## 🛠️ Preprocessing\n\n### 0. Slice audio\n\nTo avoid video memory overflow during training or pre-processing, it is recommended to limit the length of audio clips. Cutting the audio to a length of "5s - 15s" is more recommended. Slightly longer times are acceptable, however, excessively long clips may cause problems such as `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError`.\n\nTo facilitate the slicing process, you can use [audio-slicer-GUI](https://github.com/flutydeer/audio-slicer) or [audio-slicer-CLI](https://github.com/openvpi/audio-slicer)\n\nIn general, only the `Minimum Interval` needs to be adjusted. For spoken audio, the default value usually suffices, while for singing audio, it can be adjusted to around `100` or even `50`, depending on the specific requirements.\n\nAfter slicing, it is recommended to remove any audio clips that are excessively long or too short.\n\n**If you are using whisper-ppg encoder for training, the audio clips must shorter than 30s.**\n\n### 1. Resample to 44100Hz and mono\n\n```shell\npython resample.py\n```\n\n#### Cautions\n\nAlthough this project has resample.py scripts for resampling, mono and loudness matching, the default loudness matching is to match to 0db. This can cause damage to the sound quality. While python''s loudness matching package pyloudnorm does not limit the level, this can lead to sonic boom. Therefore, it is recommended to consider using professional sound processing software, such as `adobe audition` for loudness matching. If you are already using other software for loudness matching, add the parameter `-skip_loudnorm` to the run command:\n\n```shell\npython resample.py --skip_loudnorm\n```\n\n### 2. Automatically split the dataset into training and validation sets, and generate configuration files.\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_flist_config.py --speech_encoder vec768l12\n```\n\nspeech_encoder has the following options\n\n```\nvec768l12\nvec256l9\nhubertsoft\nwhisper-ppg\ncnhubertlarge\ndphubert\nwhisper-ppg-large\nwavlmbase+\n```\n\nIf the speech_encoder argument is omitted, the default value is `vec768l12`\n\n**Use loudness embedding**\n\nAdd `--vol_aug` if you want to enable loudness embedding:\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_flist_config.py --speech_encoder vec768l12 --vol_aug\n```\n\nAfter enabling loudness embedding, the trained model will match the loudness of the input source; otherwise, it will match the loudness of the training set.\n\n#### You can modify some parameters in the generated config.json and diffusion.yaml\n\n* `keep_ckpts`: Keep the the the number of previous models during training. Set to `0` to keep them all. Default is `3`.\n\n* `all_in_mem`: Load all dataset to RAM. It can be enabled when the disk IO of some platforms is too low and the system memory is **much larger** than your dataset.\n  \n* `batch_size`: The amount of data loaded to the GPU for a single training session can be adjusted to a size lower than the GPU memory capacity.\n\n* `vocoder_name`: Select a vocoder. The default is `nsf-hifigan`.\n\n##### diffusion.yaml\n\n* `cache_all_data`: Load all dataset to RAM. It can be enabled when the disk IO of some platforms is too low and the system memory is **much larger** than your dataset.\n\n* `duration`: The duration of the audio slicing during training, can be adjusted according to the size of the video memory, **Note: this value must be less than the minimum time of the audio in the training set!**\n\n* `batch_size`: The amount of data loaded to the GPU for a single training session can be adjusted to a size lower than the video memory capacity.\n\n* `timesteps`: The total number of steps in the diffusion model, which defaults to 1000.\n\n* `k_step_max`: Training can only train `k_step_max` step diffusion to save training time, note that the value must be less than `timesteps`, 0 is to train the entire diffusion model, **Note: if you do not train the entire diffusion model will not be able to use only_diffusion!**\n\n##### **List of Vocoders**\n\n```\nnsf-hifigan\nnsf-snake-hifigan\n```\n\n### 3. Generate hubert and f0\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_hubert_f0.py --f0_predictor dio\n```\n\nf0_predictor has the following options\n\n```\ncrepe\ndio\npm\nharvest\nrmvpe\nfcpe\n```\n\nIf the training set is too noisy,it is recommended to use `crepe` to handle f0\n\nIf the f0_predictor parameter is omitted, the default value is `rmvpe`\n\nIf you want shallow diffusion (optional), you need to add the `--use_diff` parameter, for example:\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_hubert_f0.py --f0_predictor dio --use_diff\n```\n\n**Speed Up preprocess**\n\nIf your dataset is pretty large,you can increase the param `--num_processes` like that:\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_hubert_f0.py --f0_predictor dio --num_processes 8\n```\nAll the worker will be assigned to different GPU if you have more than one GPUs.\n\nAfter completing the above steps, the dataset directory will contain the preprocessed data, and the dataset_raw folder can be deleted.\n\n## 🏋️‍ Training\n\n### Sovits Model\n\n```shell\npython train.py -c configs/config.json -m 44k\n```\n\n### Diffusion Model (optional)\n\nIf the shallow diffusion function is needed, the diffusion model needs to be trained. The diffusion model training method is as follows:\n\n```shell\npython train_diff.py -c configs/diffusion.yaml\n```\n\nDuring training, the model files will be saved to `logs/44k`, and the diffusion model will be saved to `logs/44k/diffusion`\n\n## 🤖 Inference\n\nUse [inference_main.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/inference_main.py)\n\n```shell\n# Example\npython inference_main.py -m "logs/44k/G_30400.pth" -c "configs/config.json" -n "君の知らない物語-src.wav" -t 0 -s "nen"\n```\n\nRequired parameters:\n- `-m` | `--model_path`: path to the model.\n- `-c` | `--config_path`: path to the configuration file.\n- `-n` | `--clean_names`: a list of wav file names located in the `raw` folder.\n- `-t` | `--trans`: pitch shift, supports positive and negative (semitone) values.\n- `-s` | `--spk_list`: Select the speaker ID to use for conversion.\n- `-cl` | `--clip`: Forced audio clipping, set to 0 to disable(default), setting it to a non-zero value (duration in seconds) to enable.\n\nOptional parameters: see the next section\n- `-lg` | `--linear_gradient`: The cross fade length of two audio slices in seconds. If there is a discontinuous voice after forced slicing, you can adjust this value. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the default value of 0.\n- `-f0p` | `--f0_predictor`: Select a F0 predictor, options are `crepe`, `pm`, `dio`, `harvest`, `rmvpe`,`fcpe`, default value is `pm`(note: f0 mean pooling will be enable when using `crepe`)\n- `-a` | `--auto_predict_f0`: automatic pitch prediction, do not enable this when converting singing voices as it can cause serious pitch issues.\n- `-cm` | `--cluster_model_path`: Cluster model or feature retrieval index path, if left blank, it will be automatically set as the default path of these models. If there is no training cluster or feature retrieval, fill in at will.\n- `-cr` | `--cluster_infer_ratio`: The proportion of clustering scheme or feature retrieval ranges from 0 to 1. If there is no training clustering model or feature retrieval, the default is 0.\n- `-eh` | `--enhance`: Whether to use NSF_HIFIGAN enhancer, this option has certain effect on sound quality enhancement for some models with few training sets, but has negative effect on well-trained models, so it is disabled by default.\n- `-shd` | `--shallow_diffusion`: Whether to use shallow diffusion, which can solve some electrical sound problems after use. This option is disabled by default. When this option is enabled, NSF_HIFIGAN enhancer will be disabled\n- `-usm` | `--use_spk_mix`: whether to use dynamic voice fusion\n- `-lea` | `--loudness_envelope_adjustment`：The adjustment of the input source''s loudness envelope in relation to the fusion ratio of the output loudness envelope. The closer to 1, the more the output loudness envelope is used\n- `-fr` | `--feature_retrieval`：Whether to use feature retrieval If clustering model is used, it will be disabled, and `cm` and `cr` parameters will become the index path and mixing ratio of feature retrieval\n  \nShallow diffusion settings:\n- `-dm` | `--diffusion_model_path`: Diffusion model path\n- `-dc` | `--diffusion_config_path`: Diffusion config file path\n- `-ks` | `--k_step`: The larger the number of k_steps, the closer it is to the result of the diffusion model. The default is 100\n- `-od` | `--only_diffusion`: Whether to use Only diffusion mode, which does not load the sovits model to only use diffusion model inference\n- `-se` | `--second_encoding`：which involves applying an additional encoding to the original audio before shallow diffusion. This option can yield varying results - sometimes positive and sometimes negative.\n\n### Cautions\n\nIf inferencing using `whisper-ppg` speech encoder, you need to set `--clip` to 25 and `-lg` to 1. Otherwise it will fail to infer properly.\n\n## 🤔 Optional Settings\n\nIf you are satisfied with the previous results, or if you do not feel you understand what follows, you can skip it and it will have no effect on the use of the model. The impact of these optional settings mentioned is relatively small, and while they may have some impact on specific datasets, in most cases the difference may not be significant.\n\n### Automatic f0 prediction\n\nDuring the training of the 4.0 model, an f0 predictor is also trained, which enables automatic pitch prediction during voice conversion. However, if the results are not satisfactory, manual pitch prediction can be used instead. Please note that when converting singing voices, it is advised not to enable this feature as it may cause significant pitch shifting.\n\n- Set `auto_predict_f0` to `true` in `inference_main.py`.\n\n### Cluster-based timbre leakage control\n\nIntroduction: The clustering scheme implemented in this model aims to reduce timbre leakage and enhance the similarity of the trained model to the target''s timbre, although the effect may not be very pronounced. However, relying solely on clustering can reduce the model''s clarity and make it sound less distinct. Therefore, a fusion method is adopted in this model to control the balance between the clustering and non-clustering approaches. This allows manual adjustment of the trade-off between "sounding like the target''s timbre" and "have clear enunciation" to find an optimal balance.\n\nNo changes are required in the existing steps. Simply train an additional clustering model, which incurs relatively low training costs.\n\n- Training process:\n  - Train on a machine with good CPU performance. According to extant experience, it takes about 4 minutes to train each speaker on a Tencent Cloud machine with 6-core CPU.\n  - Execute `python cluster/train_cluster.py`. The output model will be saved in `logs/44k/kmeans_10000.pt`.\n  - The clustering model can currently be trained using the gpu by executing `python cluster/train_cluster.py --gpu`\n- Inference process:\n  - Specify `cluster_model_path` in `inference_main.py`. If not specified, the default is `logs/44k/kmeans_10000.pt`.\n  - Specify `cluster_infer_ratio` in `inference_main.py`, where `0` means not using clustering at all, `1` means only using clustering, and usually `0.5` is sufficient.\n\n### Feature retrieval\n\nIntroduction: As with the clustering scheme, the timbre leakage can be reduced, the enunciation is slightly better than clustering, but it will reduce the inference speed. By employing the fusion method, it becomes possible to linearly control the balance between feature retrieval and non-feature retrieval, allowing for fine-tuning of the desired proportion.\n\n- Training process: \n  First, it needs to be executed after generating hubert and f0: \n\n```shell\npython train_index.py -c configs/config.json\n```\n\nThe output of the model will be in `logs/44k/feature_and_index.pkl`\n\n- Inference process: \n  - The `--feature_retrieval` needs to be formulated first, and the clustering mode automatically switches to the feature retrieval mode.\n  - Specify `cluster_model_path` in `inference_main.py`. If not specified, the default is `logs/44k/feature_and_index.pkl`.\n  - Specify `cluster_infer_ratio` in `inference_main.py`, where `0` means not using feature retrieval at all, `1` means only using feature retrieval, and usually `0.5` is sufficient.\n\n## 🗜️ Model compression\n\nThe generated model contains data that is needed for further training. If you confirm that the model is final and not be used in further training, it is safe to remove these data to get smaller file size (about 1/3).\n\n```shell\n# Example\npython compress_model.py -c="configs/config.json" -i="logs/44k/G_30400.pth" -o="logs/44k/release.pth"\n```\n\n## 👨‍🔧 Timbre mixing\n\n### Static Tone Mixing\n\n**Refer to `webUI.py` file for stable Timbre mixing of the gadget/lab feature.**\n\nIntroduction: This function can combine multiple models into one model (convex combination or linear combination of multiple model parameters) to create mixed voice that do not exist in reality\n\n**Note:**\n1. This feature is only supported for single-speaker models\n2. If you force a multi-speaker model, it is critical to make sure there are the same number of speakers in each model. This will ensure that sounds with the same SpeakerID can be mixed correctly.\n3. Ensure that the `model` fields in config.json of all models to be mixed are the same\n4. The mixed model can use any config.json file from the models being synthesized. However, the clustering model will not be functional after mixed.\n5. When batch uploading models, it is best to put the models into a folder and upload them together after selecting them\n6. It is suggested to adjust the mixing ratio between 0 and 100, or to other numbers, but unknown effects will occur in the linear combination mode\n7. After mixing, the file named output.pth will be saved in the root directory of the project\n8. Convex combination mode will perform Softmax to add the mix ratio to 1, while linear combination mode will not\n\n### Dynamic timbre mixing\n\n**Refer to the `spkmix.py` file for an introduction to dynamic timbre mixing**\n\nCharacter mix track writing rules:\n\nRole ID: \[\[Start time 1, end time 1, start value 1, start value 1], [Start time 2, end time 2, start value 2]]\n\nThe start time must be the same as the end time of the previous one. The first start time must be 0, and the last end time must be 1 (time ranges from 0 to 1).\n\nAll roles must be filled in. For unused roles, fill \[\[0., 1., 0., 0.]]\n\nThe fusion value can be filled in arbitrarily, and the linear change from the start value to the end value within the specified period of time. The \n\ninternal linear combination will be automatically guaranteed to be 1 (convex combination condition), so it can be used safely\n\nUse the `--use_spk_mix` parameter when reasoning to enable dynamic timbre mixing\n\n## 📤 Exporting to Onnx\n\nUse [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)\n\n- Create a folder named `checkpoints` and open it\n- Create a folder in the `checkpoints` folder as your project folder, naming it after your project, for example `aziplayer`\n- Rename your model as `model.pth`, the configuration file as `config.json`, and place them in the `aziplayer` folder you just created\n- Modify `"NyaruTaffy"` in `path = "NyaruTaffy"` in [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py) to your project name, `path = "aziplayer"`（onnx_export_speaker_mix makes you can mix speaker''s voice）\n- Run [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)\n- Wait for it to finish running. A `model.onnx` will be generated in your project folder, which is the exported model.\n\nNote: For Hubert Onnx models, please use the models provided by MoeSS. Currently, they cannot be exported on their own (Hubert in fairseq has many unsupported operators and things involving constants that can cause errors or result in problems with the input/output shape and results when exported.)\n\n\n## 📎 Reference\n\n| URL | Designation | Title | Implementation Source |\n| --- | ----------- | ----- | --------------------- |\n|[2106.06103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06103) | VITS (Synthesizer)| Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Adversarial Learning for End-to-End Text-to-Speech | [jaywalnut310/vits](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits) |\n|[2111.02392](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02392) | SoftVC (Speech Encoder)| A Comparison of Discrete and Soft Speech Units for Improved Voice Conversion | [bshall/hubert](https://github.com/bshall/hubert) |\n|[2204.09224](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09224) | ContentVec (Speech Encoder)| ContentVec: An Improved Self-Supervised Speech Representation by Disentangling Speakers | [auspicious3000/contentvec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec) |\n|[2212.04356](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) | Whisper (Speech Encoder) | Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision | [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) |\n|[2110.13900](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13900) | WavLM (Speech Encoder) | WavLM: Large-Scale Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Full Stack Speech Processing | [microsoft/unilm/wavlm](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/wavlm) |\n|[2305.17651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17651) | DPHubert (Speech Encoder) | DPHuBERT: Joint Distillation and Pruning of Self-Supervised Speech Models | [pyf98/DPHuBERT](https://github.com/pyf98/DPHuBERT) |\n|[DOI:10.21437/Interspeech.2017-68](http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2017-68) | Harvest (F0 Predictor) | Harvest: A high-performance fundamental frequency estimator from speech signals | [mmorise/World/harvest](https://github.com/mmorise/World/blob/master/src/harvest.cpp) |\n|[aes35-000039](https://www.aes.org/e-lib/online/browse.cfm?elib=15165) | Dio (F0 Predictor) | Fast and reliable F0 estimation method based on the period extraction of vocal fold vibration of singing voice and speech | [mmorise/World/dio](https://github.com/mmorise/World/blob/master/src/dio.cpp) |\n|[8461329](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8461329) | Crepe (F0 Predictor) | Crepe: A Convolutional Representation for Pitch Estimation | [maxrmorrison/torchcrepe](https://github.com/maxrmorrison/torchcrepe) |\n|[DOI:10.1016/j.wocn.2018.07.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2018.07.001) | Parselmouth (F0 Predictor) | Introducing Parselmouth: A Python interface to Praat | [YannickJadoul/Parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth) |\n|[2306.15412v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15412v2) | RMVPE (F0 Predictor) | RMVPE: A Robust Model for Vocal Pitch Estimation in Polyphonic Music | [Dream-High/RMVPE](https://github.com/Dream-High/RMVPE) |\n|[2010.05646](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646) | HIFIGAN (Vocoder) | HiFi-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Efficient and High Fidelity Speech Synthesis | [jik876/hifi-gan](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan) |\n|[1810.11946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11946.pdf) | NSF (Vocoder) | Neural source-filter-based waveform model for statistical parametric speech synthesis | [openvpi/DiffSinger/modules/nsf_hifigan](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger/tree/refactor/modules/nsf_hifigan)\n|[2006.08195](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08195) | Snake (Vocoder) | Neural Networks Fail to Learn Periodic Functions and How to Fix It | [EdwardDixon/snake](https://github.com/EdwardDixon/snake)\n|[2105.02446v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02446v3) | Shallow Diffusion (PostProcessing)| DiffSinger: Singing Voice Synthesis via Shallow Diffusion Mechanism | [CNChTu/Diffusion-SVC](https://github.com/CNChTu/Diffusion-SVC) |\n|[K-means](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=01D65490BADCC216F350D06F84D721AD?doi=10.1.1.308.8619&rep=rep1&type=pdf) | Feature K-means Clustering (PreProcessing)| Some methods for classification and analysis of multivariate observations | This repo |\n| | Feature TopK Retrieval (PreProcessing)| Retrieval based Voice Conversion | [RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI) |\n| | whisper ppg| whisper ppg | [PlayVoice/whisper_ppg](https://github.com/PlayVoice/whisper_ppg) |\n| | bigvgan| bigvgan | [PlayVoice/so-vits-svc-5.0](https://github.com/PlayVoice/so-vits-svc-5.0/tree/bigvgan-mix-v2/vits_decoder/alias) |\n\n\n## ☀️ Previous contributors\n\nFor some reason the author deleted the original repository.

It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.\n\n- [Try out Label Studio](#try-out-label-studio)\n- [What you get from Label Studio](#what-you-get-from-label-studio)\n- [Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio](#included-templates-for-labeling-data-in-label-studio)\n- [Set up machine learning models with Label Studio](#set-up-machine-learning-models-with-Label-Studio)\n- [Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools](#integrate-label-studio-with-your-existing-tools)\n\n![Gif of Label Studio annotating different types of data](/images/annotation_examples.gif)\n\nHave a custom dataset? You can customize Label Studio to fit your needs. Read an [introductory blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-label-studio-a-swiss-army-knife-of-data-labeling-140c1be92881) to learn more. \n\n## Try out Label Studio\n\nInstall Label Studio locally or deploy it in a cloud instance. [Or sign up for a free trial of our Starter Cloud edition!](https://humansignal.com/platform/starter-cloud/) You can learn more about what each edition offers [here](https://labelstud.io/guide/label_studio_compare). \n\n- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)\n- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)\n- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)\n- [Install locally with poetry](#install-locally-with-poetry)\n- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)\n- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)\n- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)\n\n### Install locally with Docker\nOfficial Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. \nRun Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n\n```bash\ndocker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest\ndocker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest\n```\nYou can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.\n\n#### Override default Docker install\nYou can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:\n```bash\ndocker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG\n```\n\n#### Build a local image with Docker\nIf you want to build a local image, run:\n```bash\ndocker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .\n```\n\n### Run with Docker Compose\nDocker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:\n\n- Label Studio\n- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.\n- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.\n\nTo start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:\n```bash\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\n### Run with Docker Compose + MinIO\nYou can also run it with an additional MinIO server for local S3 storage. This is particularly useful when you want to \ntest the behavior with S3 storage on your local system. To start Label Studio in this way, you need to run the following command:\n````bash\n# Add sudo on Linux if you are not a member of the docker group\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.minio.yml up -d\n````\nIf you do not have a static IP address, you must create an entry in your hosts file so that both Label Studio and your \nbrowser can access the MinIO server. For more detailed instructions, please refer to [our guide on storing data](docs/source/guide/storedata.md).\n\n\n### Install locally with pip\n\n```bash\n# Requires Python >=3.8\npip install label-studio\n\n# Start the server at http://localhost:8080\nlabel-studio\n```\n\n### Install locally with poetry\n\n```bash\n### install poetry\npip install poetry\n\n### set poetry environment\npoetry new my-label-studio\ncd my-label-studio\npoetry add label-studio\n\n### activate poetry environment\npoetry shell\n\n### Start the server at http://localhost:8080\nlabel-studio\n```\n\n### Install locally with Anaconda\n\n```bash\nconda create --name label-studio\nconda activate label-studio\nconda install psycopg2\npip install label-studio\n```\n\n### Install for local development\n\nYou can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package from pypi. \n\n```bash\n# Install all package dependencies\npip install poetry\npoetry install\n# Run database migrations\npython label_studio/manage.py migrate\npython label_studio/manage.py collectstatic\n# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080\npython label_studio/manage.py runserver\n```\n\n### Deploy in a cloud instance\n\nYou can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: \n\n<a href="https://www.heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy" height="30px"></a>\n[<img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" height="30px">](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fhumansignal%2Flabel-studio%2Fdevelop%2Fazuredeploy.json)\n[<img src="https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg" height="30px">](https://deploy.cloud.run)\n\n\n#### Apply frontend changes\n\nFor information about updating the frontend, see [label-studio/web/README.md](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/develop/web/README.md#installation-instructions).\n\n\n#### Install dependencies on Windows \nTo run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you''re using the correct version of Python:\n- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)\n\n```bash\n# Upgrade pip \npip install -U pip\n\n# If you''re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:\npip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl\n\n# Install label studio\npip install label-studio\n```\n\n### Run test suite\nTo add the tests'' dependencies to your local install:\n\n```bash\npoetry install --with test\n```\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to run the unit tests from a Docker container in which the test dependencies are installed:\n\n\n```bash\nmake build-testing-image\nmake docker-testing-shell\n```\n\nIn either case, to run the unit tests:\n\n```bash\ncd label_studio\n\n# sqlite3\nDJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio pytest -vv\n\n# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass. Will not work in Docker\n# testing container without additional configuration)\nDJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio pytest -vv\n```\n \n## What you get from Label Studio\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/525ad5ff-6904-4398-b507-7e8954268d69\n\n- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it''s tied to your account.\n- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.\n- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.\n- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.\n- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. \n- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. \n- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.\n- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline\n\n## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio \n\nLabel Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:\n\n<img src="/images/template-types.png" />\n\n## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio\n\nConnect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-ml-backend).\n2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.\n\nThis lets you:\n\n- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. \n- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. \n- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.\n\n## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools\n\nYou can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  \n\n## Ecosystem\n\n| Project | Description |\n|-|-|\n| label-studio | Server, distributed as a pip package |\n| [Frontend library](web/libs/editor/) | The Label Studio frontend library.

Our new one-step image-to-image translation methods can support both paired and unpaired training and produce better results by leveraging the pre-trained StableDiffusion-Turbo model. The inference time for 512x512 image is 0.29 sec on A6000 and 0.11 sec on A100.\n\nPlease check out [contrastive-unpaired-translation](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation) (CUT), our new unpaired image-to-image translation model that enables fast and memory-efficient training.\n\nWe provide PyTorch implementations for both unpaired and paired image-to-image translation.\n\nThe code was written by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://github.com/junyanz) and [Taesung Park](https://github.com/taesungp), and supported by [Tongzhou Wang](https://github.com/SsnL).\n\nThis PyTorch implementation produces results comparable to or better than our original Torch software. If you would like to reproduce the same results as in the papers, check out the original [CycleGAN Torch](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) and [pix2pix Torch](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) code in Lua/Torch.\n\n**Note**: The current software works well with PyTorch 2.4+. Check out the older [branch](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/tree/pytorch0.3.1) that supports PyTorch 0.1-0.3.\n\nYou may find useful information in [training/test tips](docs/tips.md) and [frequently asked questions](docs/qa.md).

For Conda users, you can create a new Conda environment by\n\n```bash\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n```\n\nand then activate the environment by\n\n```bash\nconda activate pytorch-img2img\n```\n\n- For Docker users, we provide the pre-built Docker image and Dockerfile. Please refer to our [Docker](docs/docker.md) page.\n- For Repl users, please click [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)](https://repl.it/github/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).\n\n### CycleGAN train/test\n\n- Download a CycleGAN dataset (e.g. maps):\n\n```bash\nbash ./datasets/download_cyclegan_dataset.sh maps\n```\n\n- To log training progress and test images to W&B dashboard, set the `--use_wandb` flag with training script\n- Train a model:\n\n```bash\n#!./scripts/train_cyclegan.sh\npython train.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan --use_wandb\n```\n\nTo see more intermediate results, check out `./checkpoints/maps_cyclegan/web/index.html`.\n\n- Test the model:\n\n```bash\n#!./scripts/test_cyclegan.sh\npython test.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan\n```\n\n- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/maps_cyclegan/latest_test/index.html`.\n\n### pix2pix train/test\n\n- Download a pix2pix dataset (e.g.[facades](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/)):\n\n```bash\nbash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades\n```\n\n- To log training progress and test images to W&B dashboard, set the `--use_wandb` flag with training script\n- Train a model:\n\n```bash\n#!./scripts/train_pix2pix.sh\npython train.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA  --use_wandb\n```\n\nTo see more intermediate results, check out `./checkpoints/facades_pix2pix/web/index.html`.\n\n- Test the model (`bash ./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh`):\n\n```bash\n#!./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh\npython test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA\n```\n\n- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/facades_pix2pix/test_latest/index.html`. You can find more scripts at `scripts` directory.\n- To train and test pix2pix-based colorization models, please add `--model colorization` and `--dataset_mode colorization`. See our training [tips](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/docs/tips.md#notes-on-colorization) for more details.\n\n### Apply a pre-trained model (CycleGAN)\n\n- You can download a pretrained model (e.g. horse2zebra) with the following script:\n\n```bash\nbash ./scripts/download_cyclegan_model.sh horse2zebra\n```\n\n- The pretrained model is saved at `./checkpoints/{name}_pretrained/latest_net_G.pth`. Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_cyclegan_model.sh#L3) for all the available CycleGAN models.\n- To test the model, you also need to download the horse2zebra dataset:\n\n```bash\nbash ./datasets/download_cyclegan_dataset.sh horse2zebra\n```\n\n- Then generate the results using\n\n```bash\npython test.py --dataroot datasets/horse2zebra/testA --name horse2zebra_pretrained --model test --no_dropout\n```\n\n- The option `--model test` is used for generating results of CycleGAN only for one side. This option will automatically set `--dataset_mode single`, which only loads the images from one set. On the contrary, using `--model cycle_gan` requires loading and generating results in both directions, which is sometimes unnecessary. The results will be saved at `./results/`. Use `--results_dir {directory_path_to_save_result}` to specify the results directory.\n\n- For pix2pix and your own models, you need to explicitly specify `--netG`, `--norm`, `--no_dropout` to match the generator architecture of the trained model. See this [FAQ](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/docs/qa.md#runtimeerror-errors-in-loading-state_dict-812-671461-296) for more details.\n\n### Apply a pre-trained model (pix2pix)\n\nDownload a pre-trained model with `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`.\n\n- Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh#L3) for all the available pix2pix models. For example, if you would like to download label2photo model on the Facades dataset,\n\n```bash\nbash ./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh facades_label2photo\n```\n\n- Download the pix2pix facades datasets:\n\n```bash\nbash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades\n```\n\n- Then generate the results using\n\n```bash\npython test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades/ --direction BtoA --model pix2pix --name facades_label2photo_pretrained\n```\n\n- Note that we specified `--direction BtoA` as Facades dataset''s A to B direction is photos to labels.\n\n- If you would like to apply a pre-trained model to a collection of input images (rather than image pairs), please use `--model test` option. See `./scripts/test_single.sh` for how to apply a model to Facade label maps (stored in the directory `facades/testB`).\n\n- See a list of currently available models at `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`\n\n### Multi-GPU training\n\nTo train a model on multiple GPUs, please use `torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 train.py ...` instead of `python train.py ...`. We also need to use synchronized batchnorm by setting `--norm sync_batch` (or `--norm sync_instance` for instance normgalization). The `--norm batch` is not compatible with DDP.\n\n## [Docker](docs/docker.md)\n\nWe provide the pre-built Docker image and Dockerfile that can run this code repo.

Build and launch using the instructions above.\n2. Click ''Change default saved annotation folder'' in Menu/File\n3. Click ''Open Dir''\n4. Click ''Create RectBox''\n5. Click and release left mouse to select a region to annotate the rect\n   box\n6. You can use right mouse to drag the rect box to copy or move it\n\nThe annotation will be saved to the folder you specify.\n\nYou can refer to the below hotkeys to speed up your workflow.\n\nSteps (YOLO)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1. In ``data/predefined_classes.txt`` define the list of classes that will be used for your training.\n\n2. Build and launch using the instructions above.\n\n3. Right below "Save" button in the toolbar, click "PascalVOC" button to switch to YOLO format.\n\n4. You may use Open/OpenDIR to process single or multiple images. When finished with a single image, click save.\n\nA txt file of YOLO format will be saved in the same folder as your image with same name. A file named "classes.txt" is saved to that folder too. "classes.txt" defines the list of class names that your YOLO label refers to.\n\nNote:\n\n- Your label list shall not change in the middle of processing a list of images. When you save an image, classes.txt will also get updated, while previous annotations will not be updated.\n\n- You shouldn''t use "default class" function when saving to YOLO format, it will not be referred.\n\n- When saving as YOLO format, "difficult" flag is discarded.\n\nCreate pre-defined classes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can edit the\n`data/predefined\_classes.txt <https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg/blob/master/data/predefined_classes.txt>`__\nto load pre-defined classes\n\nAnnotation visualization\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1. Copy the existing lables file to same folder with the images. The labels file name must be same with image file name.\n\n2. Click File and choose ''Open Dir'' then Open the image folder.\n\n3. Select image in File List, it will appear the bounding box and label for all objects in that image.\n\n(Choose Display Labels mode in View to show/hide lablels)\n\n\nHotkeys\n~~~~~~~\n\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + u           | Load all of the images from a directory    |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + r           | Change the default annotation target dir   |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + s           | Save                                       |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + d           | Copy the current label and rect box        |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + Shift + d   | Delete the current image                   |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Space              | Flag the current image as verified         |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| w                  | Create a rect box                          |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| d                  | Next image                                 |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| a                  | Previous image                             |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| del                | Delete the selected rect box               |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl++             | Zoom in                                    |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl--             | Zoom out                                   |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| ↑→↓←               | Keyboard arrows to move selected rect box  |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n\n**Verify Image:**\n\nWhen pressing space, the user can flag the image as verified, a green background will appear.\nThis is used when creating a dataset automatically, the user can then through all the pictures and flag them instead of annotate them.\n\n**Difficult:**\n\nThe difficult field is set to 1 indicates that the object has been annotated as "difficult", for example, an object which is clearly visible but difficult to recognize without substantial use of context.\nAccording to your deep neural network implementation, you can include or exclude difficult objects during training.\n\nHow to reset the settings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn case there are issues with loading the classes, you can either:\n\n1.

The workflow of our system consists of four stages:\n+ **Task Planning**: Using ChatGPT to analyze the requests of users to understand their intention, and disassemble them into possible solvable tasks.\n+ **Model Selection**: To solve the planned tasks, ChatGPT selects expert models hosted on Hugging Face based on their descriptions.\n+ **Task Execution**: Invokes and executes each selected model, and return the results to ChatGPT.\n+ **Response Generation**: Finally, using ChatGPT to integrate the prediction of all models, and generate responses.\n\n<p align="center"><img src="./hugginggpt/assets/overview.jpg"></p>\n\n### System Requirements\n\n#### Default (Recommended)\n\nFor `configs/config.default.yaml`:\n\n+ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n+ VRAM >= 24GB\n+ RAM > 12GB (minimal), 16GB (standard), 80GB (full)\n+ Disk > 284GB \n  + 42GB for `damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b`\n  + 126GB for `ControlNet`\n  + 66GB for `stable-diffusion-v1-5`\n  + 50GB for others\n  \n#### Minimum (Lite)\n\nFor `configs/config.lite.yaml`:\n\n+ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n+ Nothing else\n\nThe configuration `configs/config.lite.yaml` does not require any expert models to be downloaded and deployed locally. However, it means that Jarvis is restricted to models running stably on HuggingFace Inference Endpoints.\n\n### Quick Start\n\nFirst replace `openai.key` and `huggingface.token` in `server/configs/config.default.yaml` with **your personal OpenAI Key** and **your Hugging Face Token**, or put them in the environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN` respectively. Then run the following commands:\n\n<span id="Server"></span>\n\n#### For Server:\n\n```bash\n# setup env\ncd server\nconda create -n jarvis python=3.8\nconda activate jarvis\nconda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# download models. Make sure that `git-lfs` is installed.\ncd models\nbash download.sh # required when `inference_mode` is `local` or `hybrid`. \n\n# run server\ncd ..\npython models_server.py --config configs/config.default.yaml # required when `inference_mode` is `local` or `hybrid`\npython awesome_chat.py --config configs/config.default.yaml --mode server # for text-davinci-003\n```\n\nNow you can access Jarvis'' services by the Web API. \n\n+ `/hugginggpt` --method `POST`, access the full service.\n+ `/tasks` --method `POST`, access intermediate results for Stage #1.\n+ `/results` --method `POST`, access intermediate results for Stage #1-3.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n# request\ncurl --location ''http://localhost:8004/tasks'' \\n--header ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n--data ''{\n    "messages": [\n        {\n            "role": "user",\n            "content": "based on pose of /examples/d.jpg and content of /examples/e.jpg, please show me a new image"\n        }\n    ]\n}''\n\n# response\n[{"args":{"image":"/examples/d.jpg"},"dep":[-1],"id":0,"task":"openpose-control"},{"args":{"image":"/examples/e.jpg"},"dep":[-1],"id":1,"task":"image-to-text"},{"args":{"image":"<GENERATED>-0","text":"<GENERATED>-1"},"dep":[1,0],"id":2,"task":"openpose-text-to-image"}]\n```\n\n\n#### For Web:\n\nWe provide a user-friendly web page. After starting `awesome_chat.py` in a server mode, you can run the commands to communicate with Jarvis in your browser:\n \n- you need to install `nodejs` and `npm` first.\n- [ IMPORTANT ] if you are running the web client on another machine, you need set `http://{LAN_IP_of_the_server}:{port}/` to `HUGGINGGPT_BASE_URL` of `web/src/config/index.ts`.\n- if you want to use the video generation feature, you need to compile `ffmpeg` manually with H.264.\n- you can switch to ChatGPT by `double click` on the setting icon!\n\n```bash\ncd web\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n```bash\n# Optional: Install ffmpeg\n# This command need be executed without errors.\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 output.mp4\n```\n\n<span id="Gradio"></span>\n\n#### For Gradio\n\nThe Gradio demo is now hosted on Hugging Face Space. You can also run the following commands to start the demo locally:\n\n```bash\npython models_server.py --config configs/config.gradio.yaml\npython run_gradio_demo.py --config configs/config.gradio.yaml\n\n# or run the HF Space as a Docker image (Build with `inference_mode=hibrid` and `local_deployment=standard`)\ndocker run -it -p 7860:7860 --platform=linux/amd64 registry.hf.space/microsoft-hugginggpt:latest python app.py\n```\n\n#### For CLI:\n\nYou can also run Jarvis more easily in CLI mode:\n\n```bash\ncd server\npython awesome_chat.py --config configs/config.default.yaml --mode cli\n```\n\nExamples of CLI mode:\n\n```\nWelcome to Jarvis! A collaborative system that consists of an LLM as the controller and numerous expert models as collaborative executors. Jarvis can plan tasks, schedule Hugging Face models, generate friendly responses based on your requests, and help you with many things. Please enter your request (`exit` to exit).\n[ User ]: Given a collection of image A: /examples/a.jpg, B: /examples/b.jpg, C: /examples/c.jpg, please tell me how many zebras in these picture?\n[ Jarvis ]: Based on your request, I have used several models to process the images you provided. For the image A: /examples/a.jpg, I used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text "a cat sitting on a window sill looking out". Then I used the object-detection model facebook/detr-resnet-50 to generate the image with predicted box ''/images/a3dc.jpg'', which contains two objects with labels ''potted plant'' and ''cat''. For the image B: /examples/b.jpg, I used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text "two zebras standing in a field of dry grass". Then I used the object-detection model facebook/detr-resnet-50 to generate the image with predicted box ''/images/f5df.jpg'', which contains three objects with labels ''zebra''. For the image C: /examples/c.jpg, I used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text "a zebra standing in a field of tall grass". Then I used the object-detection model facebook/detr-resnet-50 to generate the image with predicted box ''/images/69c7.jpg'', which contains one object with label ''zebra''. Finally, I used the canny-control model canny-control to generate the image ''/images/7e18.png'' based on the image /examples/f.jpg. Therefore, there are four zebras in these pictures. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n[ User ]: Please answer all the named entities in the sentence: Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby.\n[ Jarvis ]: Sure, I understand your request. Based on the inference results of the models, I will answer your request step by step. Firstly, I used the token-classification model dslim/bert-base-NER to recognize the named entities in the sentence. The inference result is that the named entities are Iron Man, Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Then, I used the question-answering model deepset/roberta-base-squad2 to answer your request. The inference result is that there is no output since the context cannot be empty. Therefore, I cannot make it. I hope this answer your request. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n[ User ]: Please generate a canny image based on /examples/f.jpg\n[ Jarvis ]: Sure. I have generated a canny image based on /examples/f.jpg. To do this, I first used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text description of the image, which is "a herd of giraffes and zebras grazing in a field". Then I used the canny-control model to generate the canny image of the original image, which is stored in the path "/images/1ea2.png". Finally, I used the canny-text-to-image model lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-canny to generate the canny image based on the text description and the canny image, which is stored in the path "/images/ba66.png". Do you need anything else?\n```\n\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe server-side configuration file is `server/configs/config.default.yaml`, and some parameters are presented as follows:\n\n+ `model`: LLM, currently supports `text-davinci-003`. We are working on integrating more open-source LLMs.\n+ `inference_mode`: mode of inference endpoints\n  + `local`: only use the local inference endpoints\n  + `huggingface`: only use the Hugging Face Inference Endpoints **(free of local inference endpoints)**\n  + `hybrid`: both of `local` and `huggingface`\n+ `local_deployment`: scale of locally deployed models, works under `local` or `hybrid` inference mode:\n  +  `minimal` (RAM>12GB, ControlNet only)\n  +  `standard` (RAM>16GB, ControlNet + Standard Pipelines)\n  +  `full` (RAM>42GB, All registered models)\n\nOn a personal laptop, we recommend the configuration of `inference_mode: hybrid `and `local_deployment: minimal`. But the available models under this setting may be limited due to the instability of remote Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.\n\n### NVIDIA Jetson Embedded Device Support\nA [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile.jetson) is included that provides experimental support for [NVIDIA Jetson embedded devices](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing).  This image provides accelerated ffmpeg, pytorch, torchaudio, and torchvision dependencies.  To build the docker image, [ensure that the default docker runtime is set to ''nvidia''](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Advanced-topics#default-runtime).  A pre-built image is provided at https://hub.docker.com/r/toolboc/nv-jarvis.\n\n```bash\n#Build the docker image\ndocker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile.jetson" -t toolboc/nv-jarvis:r35.2.1 \n```\n\nDue to to memory requirements, JARVIS is required to run on Jetson AGX Orin family devices (64G on-board RAM device preferred) with config options set to:\n* `inference_mode: local` \n* `local_deployment: standard`  \n\nModels and configs are recommended to be provided through a volume mount from the host to the container as shown in the `docker run` step below.  It is possible to uncomment the `# Download local models` section of the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile.jetson) to build a container with models included.\n\n#### Start the model server, awesomechat, and web app on Jetson Orin AGX\n\n```bash\n# run the container which will automatically start the model server\ndocker run --name jarvis --net=host --gpus all -v ~/jarvis/configs:/app/server/configs -v ~/src/JARVIS/server/models:/app/server/models toolboc/nv-jarvis:r35.2.1\n\n# (wait for model server to complete initialization)\n\n# start awesome_chat.py \ndocker exec jarvis python3 awesome_chat.py --config configs/config.default.yaml --mode server\n\n#start the web application (application will be acessible at http://localhost:9999)\ndocker exec jarvis npm run dev --prefix=/app/web\n```\n\n### Screenshots\n\n<p align="center"><img src="./hugginggpt/assets/screenshot_q.jpg"><img src="./hugginggpt/assets/screenshot_a.jpg"></p>\n\n\n\n\n## Citation\nIf you find this work useful in your method, you can cite the paper as below:\n\n    @inproceedings{shen2023hugginggpt,\n      author = {Shen, Yongliang and Song, Kaitao and Tan, Xu and Li, Dongsheng and Lu, Weiming and Zhuang, Yueting},\n      booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n      title = {HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace},\n      year = {2023}\n    }\n\n>\n    @article{shen2023taskbench,\n      title   = {TaskBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Task Automation},\n      author  = {Shen, Yongliang and Song, Kaitao and Tan, Xu and Zhang, Wenqi and Ren, Kan and Yuan, Siyu and Lu, Weiming and Li, Dongsheng and Zhuang, Yueting},\n      journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.18760},\n      year    = {2023}\n    }\n\n>\n    @article{yuan2024easytool,\n      title   = {EASYTOOL: Enhancing LLM-based Agents with Concise Tool Instruction},\n      author  = {Siyu Yuan and Kaitao Song and Jiangjie Chen and Xu Tan and Yongliang Shen and Ren Kan and Dongsheng Li and Deqing Yang},\n      journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.06201},\n      year    = {2024}\n    }\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":24485,"forks":2057,"watchers":24485,"open_issues":521,"topics":["deep-learning","platform","pytorch"],"default_branch":"main","size_kb":41674,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:langchain-ai:langchain","source_url":"https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:NVIDIA:nvidia-docker","source_url":"https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 80, '369e288e7826121d407a77ded6f13ddb', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

for New Users](#quick-tour-for-new-users)\n- [Architecture Overview](#architecture-overview)\n- [Implemented GNN Models](#implemented-gnn-models)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n\n## Library Highlights\n\nWhether you are a machine learning researcher or first-time user of machine learning toolkits, here are some reasons to try out PyG for machine learning on graph-structured data.\n\n- **Easy-to-use and unified API**:\n  All it takes is 10-20 lines of code to get started with training a GNN model (see the next section for a [quick tour](#quick-tour-for-new-users)).\n  PyG is *PyTorch-on-the-rocks*: It utilizes a tensor-centric API and keeps design principles close to vanilla PyTorch.\n  If you are already familiar with PyTorch, utilizing PyG is straightforward.\n- **Comprehensive and well-maintained GNN models**:\n  Most of the state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network architectures have been implemented by library developers or authors of research papers and are ready to be applied.\n- **Great flexibility**:\n  Existing PyG models can easily be extended for conducting your own research with GNNs.\n  Making modifications to existing models or creating new architectures is simple, thanks to its easy-to-use message passing API, and a variety of operators and utility functions.\n- **Large-scale real-world GNN models**:\n  We focus on the need of GNN applications in challenging real-world scenarios, and support learning on diverse types of graphs, including but not limited to: scalable GNNs for graphs with millions of nodes; dynamic GNNs for node predictions over time; heterogeneous GNNs with multiple node types and edge types.\n\n## Quick Tour for New Users\n\nIn this quick tour, we highlight the ease of creating and training a GNN model with only a few lines of code.\n\n### Train your own GNN model\n\nIn the first glimpse of PyG, we implement the training of a GNN for classifying papers in a citation graph.\nFor this, we load the [Cora](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.Planetoid.html) dataset, and create a simple 2-layer GCN model using the pre-defined [`GCNConv`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.GCNConv.html):\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv\nfrom torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid\n\ndataset = Planetoid(root=''.'', name=''Cora'')\n\nclass GCN(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv1 = GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)\n        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, out_channels)\n\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor, edge_index: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # x: Node feature matrix of shape [num_nodes, in_channels]\n        # edge_index: Graph connectivity matrix of shape [2, num_edges]\n        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index).relu()\n        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)\n        return x\n\nmodel = GCN(dataset.num_features, 16, dataset.num_classes)\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>We can now optimize the model in a training loop, similar to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/optimization_tutorial.html#full-implementation">standard PyTorch training procedure</a>.</summary>\n\n```python\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndata = dataset[0]\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n\nfor epoch in range(200):\n    pred = model(data.x, data.edge_index)\n    loss = F.cross_entropy(pred[data.train_mask], data.y[data.train_mask])\n\n    # Backpropagation\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n```\n\n</details>\n\nMore information about evaluating final model performance can be found in the corresponding [example](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/gcn.py).\n\n### Create your own GNN layer\n\nIn addition to the easy application of existing GNNs, PyG makes it simple to implement custom Graph Neural Networks (see [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/create_gnn.html) for the accompanying tutorial).\nFor example, this is all it takes to implement the [edge convolutional layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07829) from Wang *et al.*:\n\n$$x_i^{\\prime} ~ = ~ \\max\_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} ~ \\textrm{MLP}\_{\\theta} \\left( [ ~ x_i, ~ x_j - x_i ~ ] \\right)$$\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torch.nn import Sequential, Linear, ReLU\nfrom torch_geometric.nn import MessagePassing\n\nclass EdgeConv(MessagePassing):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):\n        super().__init__(aggr="max")  # "Max" aggregation.\n        self.mlp = Sequential(\n            Linear(2 * in_channels, out_channels),\n            ReLU(),\n            Linear(out_channels, out_channels),\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor, edge_index: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # x: Node feature matrix of shape [num_nodes, in_channels]\n        # edge_index: Graph connectivity matrix of shape [2, num_edges]\n        return self.propagate(edge_index, x=x)  # shape [num_nodes, out_channels]\n\n    def message(self, x_j: Tensor, x_i: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # x_j: Source node features of shape [num_edges, in_channels]\n        # x_i: Target node features of shape [num_edges, in_channels]\n        edge_features = torch.cat([x_i, x_j - x_i], dim=-1)\n        return self.mlp(edge_features)  # shape [num_edges, out_channels]\n```\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nPyG provides a multi-layer framework that enables users to build Graph Neural Network solutions on both low and high levels.\nIt comprises of the following components:\n\n- The PyG **engine** utilizes the powerful PyTorch deep learning framework with full [`torch.compile`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/compile.html) and [TorchScript](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/jit.html) support, as well as additions of efficient CPU/CUDA libraries for operating on sparse data, *e.g.*, [`pyg-lib`](https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib).\n- The PyG **storage** handles data processing, transformation and loading pipelines. It is capable of handling and processing large-scale graph datasets, and provides effective solutions for heterogeneous graphs. It further provides a variety of sampling solutions, which enable training of GNNs on large-scale graphs.\n- The PyG **operators** bundle essential functionalities for implementing Graph Neural Networks. PyG supports important GNN building blocks that can be combined and applied to various parts of a GNN model, ensuring rich flexibility of GNN design.\n- Finally, PyG provides an abundant set of GNN **models**, and examples that showcase GNN models on standard graph benchmarks. Thanks to its flexibility, users can easily build and modify custom GNN models to fit their specific needs.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="100%"

models, layers and operators according to category:\n\n**GNN layers:**\nAll Graph Neural Network layers are implemented via the **[`nn.MessagePassing`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.MessagePassing.html)** interface.\nA GNN layer specifies how to perform message passing, *i.e.* by designing different message, aggregation and update functions as defined [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/create_gnn.html).\nThese GNN layers can be stacked together to create Graph Neural Network models.\n\n- **[GCNConv](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.GCNConv.html)** from Kipf and Welling:

Networks that can scale to large-scale graphs.\nSuch application is challenging since the entire graph, its associated features and the GNN parameters cannot fit into GPU memory.\nMany state-of-the-art scalability approaches tackle this challenge by sampling neighborhoods for mini-batch training, graph clustering and partitioning, or by using simplified GNN models.\nThese approaches have been implemented in PyG, and can benefit from the above GNN layers, operators and models.\n\n-

Installation\n\nPyG is available for Python 3.10 to Python 3.13.\n\nFrom **PyG 2.3** onwards, you can install and use PyG **without any external library** required except for PyTorch.\nFor this, simply run\n\n```\npip install torch_geometric\n```\n\n### Additional Libraries\n\nIf you want to utilize the full set of features from PyG, there exists several additional libraries you may want to install:\n\n- **[`pyg-lib`](https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib)**: Heterogeneous GNN operators and graph sampling routines\n- **[`torch-scatter`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter)**: Accelerated and efficient sparse reductions\n- **[`torch-sparse`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_sparse)**:

based on the [PyTorch C++/CUDA/hip(ROCm) extension interface](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp).\nFor a basic usage of PyG, these dependencies are **fully optional**.\nWe recommend to start with a minimal installation, and install additional dependencies once you start to actually need them.\n\nFor ease of installation of these extensions, we provide `pip` wheels for all major OS/PyTorch/CUDA combinations, see [here](https://data.pyg.org/whl).\n\n#### PyTorch 2.8\n\nTo install the binaries for PyTorch 2.8.0, simply run\n\n```\npip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse

The audio is decoded with the Python library [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) which bundles the FFmpeg libraries in its package.\n\n### GPU\n\nGPU execution requires the following NVIDIA libraries to be installed:\n\n* [cuBLAS for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas)\n* [cuDNN 9 for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)\n\n**Note**: The latest versions of `ctranslate2` only support CUDA 12 and cuDNN 9. For CUDA 11 and cuDNN 8, the current workaround is downgrading to the `3.24.0` version of `ctranslate2`, for CUDA 12 and cuDNN 8, downgrade to the `4.4.0` version of `ctranslate2`, (This can be done with `pip install --force-reinstall ctranslate2==4.4.0` or specifying the version in a `requirements.txt`).\n\nThere are multiple ways to install the NVIDIA libraries mentioned above. The recommended way is described in the official NVIDIA documentation, but we also suggest other installation methods below. \n\n<details>\n<summary>Other installation methods (click to expand)</summary>\n\n\n**Note:** For all these methods below, keep in mind the above note regarding CUDA versions. Depending on your setup, you may need to install the _CUDA 11_ versions of libraries that correspond to the CUDA 12 libraries listed in the instructions below.\n\n#### Use Docker\n\nThe libraries (cuBLAS, cuDNN) are installed in this official NVIDIA CUDA Docker images: `nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-cudnn9-runtime-ubuntu22.04`.\n\n#### Install with `pip` (Linux only)\n\nOn Linux these libraries can be installed with `pip`. Note that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` must be set before launching Python.\n\n```bash\npip install nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12==9.*\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`python3 -c ''import os; import nvidia.cublas.lib; import nvidia.cudnn.lib; print(os.path.dirname(nvidia.cublas.lib.__file__) + ":" + os.path.dirname(nvidia.cudnn.lib.__file__))''`\n```\n\n#### Download the libraries from Purfview''s repository (Windows & Linux)\n\nPurfview''s [whisper-standalone-win](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win) provides the required NVIDIA libraries for Windows & Linux in a [single archive](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases/tag/libs). Decompress the archive and place the libraries in a directory included in the `PATH`.\n\n</details>\n\n## Installation\n\nThe module can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/faster-whisper/):\n\n```bash\npip install faster-whisper\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Other installation methods (click to expand)</summary>\n\n### Install the master branch\n\n```bash\npip install --force-reinstall "faster-whisper @ https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz"\n```\n\n### Install a specific commit\n\n```bash\npip install --force-reinstall "faster-whisper @ https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/archive/a4f1cc8f11433e454c3934442b5e1a4ed5e865c3.tar.gz"\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Usage\n\n### Faster-whisper\n\n```python\nfrom faster_whisper import WhisperModel\n\nmodel_size = "large-v3"\n\n# Run on GPU with FP16\nmodel = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")\n\n# or run on GPU with INT8\n# model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="int8_float16")\n# or run on CPU with INT8\n# model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cpu", compute_type="int8")\n\nsegments, info = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", beam_size=5)\n\nprint("Detected language ''%s'' with probability %f" % (info.language, info.language_probability))\n\nfor segment in segments:\n    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))\n```\n\n**Warning:** `segments` is a *generator* so the transcription only starts when you iterate over it. The transcription can be run to completion by gathering the segments in a list or a `for` loop:\n\n```python\nsegments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3")\nsegments = list(segments)  # The transcription will actually run here.\n```\n\n### Batched Transcription\nThe following code snippet illustrates how to run batched transcription on an example audio file. `BatchedInferencePipeline.transcribe` is a drop-in replacement for `WhisperModel.transcribe`\n\n```python\nfrom faster_whisper import WhisperModel, BatchedInferencePipeline\n\nmodel = WhisperModel("turbo", device="cuda", compute_type="float16")\nbatched_model = BatchedInferencePipeline(model=model)\nsegments, info = batched_model.transcribe("audio.mp3", batch_size=16)\n\nfor segment in segments:\n    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))\n```\n\n### Faster Distil-Whisper\n\nThe Distil-Whisper checkpoints are compatible with the Faster-Whisper package. In particular, the latest [distil-large-v3](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v3)\ncheckpoint is intrinsically designed to work with the Faster-Whisper transcription algorithm. The following code snippet \ndemonstrates how to run inference with distil-large-v3 on a specified audio file:\n\n```python\nfrom faster_whisper import WhisperModel\n\nmodel_size = "distil-large-v3"\n\nmodel = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")\nsegments, info = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", beam_size=5, language="en", condition_on_previous_text=False)\n\nfor segment in segments:\n    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))\n```\n\nFor more information about the distil-large-v3 model, refer to the original [model card](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v3).\n\n### Word-level timestamps\n\n```python\nsegments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", word_timestamps=True)\n\nfor segment in segments:\n    for word in segment.words:\n        print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (word.start, word.end, word.word))\n```\n\n### VAD filter\n\nThe library integrates the [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) model to filter out parts of the audio without speech:\n\n```python\nsegments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", vad_filter=True)\n```\n\nThe default behavior is conservative and only removes silence longer than 2 seconds. See the available VAD parameters and default values in the [source code](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/blob/master/faster_whisper/vad.py). They can be customized with the dictionary argument `vad_parameters`:\n\n```python\nsegments, _ = model.transcribe(\n    "audio.mp3",\n    vad_filter=True,\n    vad_parameters=dict(min_silence_duration_ms=500),\n)\n```\nVad filter is enabled by default for batched transcription.\n\n### Logging\n\nThe library logging level can be configured like this:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig()\nlogging.getLogger("faster_whisper").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\n\n### Going further\n\nSee more model and transcription options in the [`WhisperModel`](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/blob/master/faster_whisper/transcribe.py) class implementation.\n\n## Community integrations\n\nHere is a non exhaustive list of open-source projects using faster-whisper. Feel free to add your project to the list!\n\n\n* [speaches](https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches) is an OpenAI compatible server using `faster-whisper`. It''s easily deployable with Docker, works with OpenAI SDKs/CLI, supports streaming, and live transcription.\n* [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) is an award-winning Python library that offers speaker diarization and accurate word-level timestamps using wav2vec2 alignment\n* [whisper-ctranslate2](https://github.com/Softcatala/whisper-ctranslate2) is a command line client based on faster-whisper and compatible with the original client from openai/whisper.\n* [whisper-diarize](https://github.com/MahmoudAshraf97/whisper-diarization) is a speaker diarization tool that is based on faster-whisper and NVIDIA NeMo.\n* [whisper-standalone-win](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win) Standalone CLI executables of faster-whisper for Windows, Linux & macOS. \n* [asr-sd-pipeline](https://github.com/hedrergudene/asr-sd-pipeline) provides a scalable, modular, end to end multi-speaker speech to text solution implemented using AzureML pipelines.\n* [Open-Lyrics](https://github.com/zh-plus/Open-Lyrics) is a Python library that transcribes voice files using faster-whisper, and translates/polishes the resulting text into `.lrc` files in the desired language using OpenAI-GPT.\n* [wscribe](https://github.com/geekodour/wscribe) is a flexible transcript generation tool supporting faster-whisper, it can export word level transcript and the exported transcript then can be edited with [wscribe-editor](https://github.com/geekodour/wscribe-editor)\n* [aTrain](https://github.com/BANDAS-Center/aTrain) is a graphical user interface implementation of faster-whisper developed at the BANDAS-Center at the University of Graz for transcription and diarization in Windows ([Windows Store App](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/atrain/9N15Q44SZNS2)) and Linux.\n* [Whisper-Streaming](https://github.com/ufal/whisper_streaming) implements real-time mode for offline Whisper-like speech-to-text models with faster-whisper as the most recommended back-end. It implements a streaming policy with self-adaptive latency based on the actual source complexity, and demonstrates the state of the art.\n* [WhisperLive](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive) is a nearly-live implementation of OpenAI''s Whisper which uses faster-whisper as the backend to transcribe audio in real-time.\n* [Faster-Whisper-Transcriber](https://github.com/BBC-Esq/ctranslate2-faster-whisper-transcriber) is a simple but reliable voice transcriber that provides a user-friendly interface.\n* [Open-dubbing](https://github.com/softcatala/open-dubbing) is open dubbing is an AI dubbing system which uses machine learning models to automatically translate and synchronize audio dialogue into different languages.\n* [Whisper-FastAPI](https://github.com/heimoshuiyu/whisper-fastapi) whisper-fastapi is a very simple script that provides an API backend compatible with OpenAI, HomeAssistant, and Konele (Android voice typing) formats.\n\n## Model conversion\n\nWhen loading a model from its size such as `WhisperModel("large-v3")`, the corresponding CTranslate2 model is automatically downloaded from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/Systran).\n\nWe also provide a script to convert any Whisper models compatible with the Transformers library. They could be the original OpenAI models or user fine-tuned models.\n\nFor example the command below converts the [original "large-v3" Whisper model](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) and saves the weights in FP16:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers[torch]>=4.23\n\nct2-transformers-converter --model openai/whisper-large-v3 --output_dir whisper-large-v3-ct2\n--copy_files tokenizer.json preprocessor_config.json --quantization float16\n```\n\n* The option `--model` accepts a model name on the Hub or a path to a model directory.\n* If the option `--copy_files tokenizer.json` is not used, the tokenizer configuration is automatically downloaded when the model is loaded later.\n\nModels can also be converted from the code. See the [conversion API](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/python/ctranslate2.converters.TransformersConverter.html).\n\n### Load a converted model\n\n1. Directly load the model from a local directory:\n```python\nmodel = faster_whisper.WhisperModel("whisper-large-v3-ct2")\n```\n\n2. [Upload your model to the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_sharing#upload-with-the-web-interface) and load it from its name:\n```python\nmodel = faster_whisper.WhisperModel("username/whisper-large-v3-ct2")\n```\n\n## Comparing performance against other implementations\n\nIf you are comparing the performance against other Whisper implementations, you should make sure to run the comparison with similar settings. In particular:\n\n* Verify that the same transcription options are used, especially the same beam size. For example in openai/whisper, `model.transcribe` uses a default beam size of 1 but here we use a default beam size of 5.\n* Transcription speed is closely affected by the number of words in the transcript, so ensure that other implementations have a similar WER (Word Error Rate) to this one.\n* When running on CPU, make sure to set the same number of threads. Many frameworks will read the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, which can be set when running your script:\n\n```bash\nOMP_NUM_THREADS=4 python3 my_script.py\n```\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":19366,"forks":1610,"watchers":19366,"open_issues":294,"topics":["deep-learning","inference","openai","quantization","speech-recognition","speech-to-text","transformer","whisper"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":40514,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:OpenNMT:CTranslate2","source_url":"https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggerganov:whisper.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggerganov:whisper.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:PyAV-Org:PyAV","source_url":"https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Purfview:whisper-standalone-win","source_url":"https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Purfview:whisper-standalone-win","source_url":"https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:snakers4:silero-vad","source_url":"https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:speaches-ai:speaches","source_url":"https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:m-bain:whisperX","source_url":"https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Softcatala:whisper-ctranslate2","source_url":"https://github.com/Softcatala/whisper-ctranslate2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:MahmoudAshraf97:whisper-diarization","source_url":"https://github.com/MahmoudAshraf97/whisper-diarization"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Purfview:whisper-standalone-win","source_url":"https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:hedrergudene:asr-sd-pipeline","source_url":"https://github.com/hedrergudene/asr-sd-pipeline"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:zh-plus:Open-Lyrics","source_url":"https://github.com/zh-plus/Open-Lyrics"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:geekodour:wscribe","source_url":"https://github.com/geekodour/wscribe"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:geekodour:wscribe-editor","source_url":"https://github.com/geekodour/wscribe-editor"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:BANDAS-Center:aTrain","source_url":"https://github.com/BANDAS-Center/aTrain"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ufal:whisper_streaming","source_url":"https://github.com/ufal/whisper_streaming"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:collabora:WhisperLive","source_url":"https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:BBC-Esq:ctranslate2-faster-whisper-transcriber","source_url":"https://github.com/BBC-Esq/ctranslate2-faster-whisper-transcriber"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:softcatala:open-dubbing","source_url":"https://github.com/softcatala/open-dubbing"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:heimoshuiyu:whisper-fastapi","source_url":"https://github.com/heimoshuiyu/whisper-fastapi"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 80, 'd320e66d3ef8f69fbf01257efd04ad5d', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

notebook代码（基于PyTorch）；docs文件夹就是markdown格式的《动手学深度学习》书中的相关内容，然后利用[docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/zh-cn/)将网页文档部署到GitHub Pages上，由于原书使用的是MXNet框架，所以docs内容可能与原书略有不同，但是整体内容是一样的。欢迎对本项目做出贡献或提出issue。\n\n## 面向人群\n本项目面向对深度学习感兴趣，尤其是想使用PyTorch进行深度学习的童鞋。本项目并不要求你有任何深度学习或者机器学习的背景知识，你只需了解基础的数学和编程，如基础的线性代数、微分和概率，以及基础的Python编程。\n\n## 食用方法 \n### 方法一\n本仓库包含一些latex公式，但github的markdown原生是不支持公式显示的，而docs文件夹已经利用[docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/zh-cn/)被部署到了GitHub Pages上，所以查看文档最简便的方法就是直接访问[本项目网页版](https://tangshusen.me/Dive-into-DL-PyTorch)。当然如果你还想跑一下运行相关代码的话还是得把本项目clone下来，然后运行code文件夹下相关代码。\n\n### 方法二\n你还可以在本地访问文档，先安装`docsify-cli`工具:\n``` shell\nnpm i docsify-cli -g\n```\n然后将本项目clone到本地:\n``` shell\ngit clone https://github.com/ShusenTang/Dive-into-DL-PyTorch.git\ncd Dive-into-DL-PyTorch\n```\n然后运行一个本地服务器，这样就可以很方便的在`http://localhost:3000`实时访问文档网页渲染效果。\n``` shell\ndocsify serve docs\n```\n\n### 方法三\n如果你不想安装`docsify-cli`工具，甚至你的电脑上都没有安装`Node.js`，而出于某些原因你又想在本地浏览文档，那么你可以在`docker`容器中运行网页服务。\n\n首先将本项目clone到本地:\n``` shell\ngit clone https://github.com/ShusenTang/Dive-into-DL-PyTorch.git\ncd Dive-into-DL-PyTorch\n```\n之后使用如下命令创建一个名称为「d2dl」的`docker`镜像：\n``` shell\ndocker build -t d2dl .\n```\n镜像创建好后，运行如下命令创建一个新的容器：\n``` shell\ndocker run -dp 3000:3000 d2dl\n```\n最后在浏览器中打开这个地址`http://localhost:3000/#/`，就能愉快地访问文档了。适合那些不想在电脑上装太多工具的小伙伴。\n\n\n## 目录\n* [简介]()\n* [阅读指南](read_guide.md)\n* [1. 深度学习简介](chapter01_DL-intro/deep-learning-intro.md)\n* 2\. 预备知识\n

Over the last few years we have been privileged to develop such key open-source machine learning projects, including the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, which has enabled its users to leverage industry-wide advancements in deep learning at scale. \n\nToday’s 2.7 release will be the last main release of CNTK. We may have some subsequent minor releases for bug fixes, but these will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. There are no plans for new feature development post this release. \n\nThe CNTK 2.7 release has full support for ONNX 1.4.1, and we encourage those seeking to operationalize their CNTK models to take advantage of ONNX and the ONNX Runtime. Moving forward, users can continue to leverage evolving ONNX innovations via the number of frameworks that support it. For example, users can natively export ONNX models from PyTorch or convert TensorFlow models to ONNX with the TensorFlow-ONNX converter. \n\nWe are incredibly grateful for all the support we have received from contributors and users over the years since the initial open-source release of CNTK. CNTK has enabled both Microsoft teams and external users to execute complex and large-scale workloads in all manner of deep learning applications, such as historical breakthroughs in speech recognition achieved by Microsoft Speech researchers, the originators of the framework. \n\nAs ONNX is increasingly employed in serving models used across Microsoft products such as Bing and Office, we are dedicated to synthesizing innovations from research with the rigorous demands of production to progress the ecosystem forward. \n\nAbove all, our goal is to make innovations in deep learning across the software and hardware stacks as open and accessible as possible. We will be working hard to bring both the existing strengths of CNTK and new state-of-the-art research into other open-source projects to truly broaden the reach of such technologies. \n\nWith gratitude, \n\n-- The CNTK Team \n\n## Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n\n## News\n\n> You can find more news on [the official project feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/news)\n\n***2019-03-29.*** CNTK 2.7.0\n## Highlights of this release\n* Moved to CUDA 10 for both Windows and Linux.\n* Support advance RNN loop in ONNX export.\n* Export larger than 2GB models in ONNX format.\n* Support FP16 in Brain Script train action.\n\n## CNTK support for CUDA 10\n\n### CNTK now supports CUDA 10. This requires an update to build environment to Visual Studio 2017 v15.9 for Windows.\n\nTo setup build and runtime environment on Windows:\n* Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Note: going forward for CUDA 10 and beyond, it is no longer required to install and run with the specific VC Tools version 14.11.\n* Install [Nvidia CUDA 10](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64)\n* From PowerShell, run:\n    [DevInstall.ps1](../Tools/devInstall/Windows/DevInstall.ps1)\n* Start Visual Studio 2017 and open [CNTK.sln](./CNTK.sln).\n\nTo setup build and runtime environment on Linux using docker, please build Unbuntu 16.04 docker image using Dockerfiles [here](./Tools/docker). For other Linux systems, please refer to the Dockerfiles to setup dependent libraries for CNTK.\n\n## Support advance RNN loop in ONNX export\nCNTK models with recursive loops can be exported to ONNX models with scan ops.\n\n## Export larger than 2GB models in ONNX format\nTo export models larger than 2GB in ONNX format, use cntk.Function API:\nsave(self, filename, format=ModelFormat.CNTKv2, use_external_files_to_store_parameters=False)\nwith ''format'' set to ModelFormat.ONNX and use_external_files_to_store_parameters set to True.\nIn this case, model parameters are saved in external files. Exported models shall be used with external parameter files when doing model evaluation with onnxruntime.\n\n***2018-11-26.***  \n[Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) now supports visualizing CNTK v1 and CNTK v2 `.model` files.\n\n<img src=https://cntk.ai/Images/netron/netron-cntk-dark-1.png alt="NetronCNTKDark1" width="300"> <img src=https://cntk.ai/Images/netron/netron-cntk-light-1.png alt="NetronCNTKLight1" width="300">\n\n\n### Project changelog\n\n***2018-09-17.*** CNTK 2.6.0\n## Efficient group convolution\nThe implementation of group convolution in CNTK has been updated. The updated implementation moves away from creating a sub-graph for group convolution (using slicing and splicing), and instead uses cuDNN7 and MKL2017 APIs directly. This improves the experience both in terms of performance and model size. \n\nAs an example, for a single group convolution op with the following attributes:\n\n- Input tensor (C, H, W) = (32, 128, 128)\n- Number of output channels = 32 (channel multiplier is 1)\n- Groups = 32 (depth wise convolution)\n- Kernel size = (5, 5)\n\nThe comparison numbers for this single node are as follows:\n\n| First Header  | GPU exec. time (in millisec., 1000 run avg.) | CPU exec. time (in millisec., 1000 run avg.) | Model Size (in KB, CNTK format)\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| Old implementation  | 9.349  | 41.921  | 38  |\n| New implementation  | 6.581  | 9.963  | 5  |\n| Speedup/savings   Approx.  | 30%  Approx.  | 65-75%   Approx.  | 87% |\n\n## Sequential Convolution\nThe implementation of sequential convolution in CNTK has been updated. The updated implementation creates a separate sequential convolution layer. Different from regular convolution layer, this operation convolves also on the dynamic axis(sequence), and filter_shape[0] is applied to that axis. The updated implementation supports broader cases, such as where stride > 1 for the sequence axis.\n\nFor example, a sequential convolution over a batch of one-channel black-and-white images. The images have the same fixed height of 640, but each with width of variable lengths. The width is then represented by sequential axis. Padding is enabled, and strides for both width and height are 2.\n\n     >>> f = SequentialConvolution((3,3), reduction_rank=0, pad=True, strides=(2,2), activation=C.relu)\n     >>> x = C.input_variable(**Sequence[Tensor[640]])\n     >>> x.shape\n         (640,)\n     >>> h = f(x)\n     >>> h.shape\n         (320,)\n     >>> f.W.shape\n         (1, 1, 3, 3)\n\n## Operators\n### depth_to_space and space_to_depth\nThere is a breaking change in the **depth_to_space** and **space_to_depth** operators. These have been updated to match ONNX specification, specifically\nthe permutation for how the depth dimension is placed as blocks in the spatial dimensions, and vice-versa, has been changed. Please refer to the updated doc\nexamples for these two ops to see the change.\n\n### Tan and Atan\nAdded support for trigonometric ops `Tan` and `Atan`.\n\n### ELU\nAdded support for `alpha` attribute in ELU op.\n\n### Convolution\nUpdated auto padding algorithms of `Convolution` to produce symmetric padding at best effort on CPU, without affecting the final convolution output values. This update increases the range of cases that could be covered by MKL API and improves the performance, E.g. ResNet50.\n\n## Default arguments order\nThere is a breaking change in the **arguments** property in CNTK python API. The default behavior has been updated to return arguments in python order instead of in C++ order. This way it will return arguments in the same order as they are fed into ops. If you wish to still get arguments in C++ order, you can simply override the global option. This change should only affect the following ops: Times, TransposeTimes, and Gemm(internal). \n\n## Bug fixes\n- Updated doc for Convolution layer to include group and dilation arguments.\n- Added improved input validation for group convolution.\n- Updated `LogSoftMax` to use more numerically stable implementation.\n- Fixed Gather op''s incorrect gradient value.\n- Added validation for ''None'' node in python clone substitution.\n- Added validation for padding channel axis in convolution.\n- Added CNTK native default lotusIR logger to fix the "Attempt to use DefaultLogger" error when loading some ONNX models.\n- Added proper initialization for ONNX TypeStrToProtoMap.\n- Updated python doctest to handle different print format for newer version numpy(version >= 1.14).\n- Fixed Pooling(CPU) to produce correct output values when kernel center is on padded input cells.\n\n## ONNX\n### Updates\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX import/export to use ONNX 1.2 spec.\n- Major update to how batch and sequence axes are handled in export and import. As a result, the complex scenarios and edge cases are handled accurately.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `BatchNormalization` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Added model domain to ONNX model export.\n- Improved error reporting during import and export of ONNX models.\n- Updated `DepthToSpace` and `SpaceToDepth` ops to match ONNX spec on the permutation for how the depth dimension is placed as block dimension.\n- Added support for exporting `alpha` attribute in `ELU` ONNX op.\n- Major overhaul to `Convolution` and `Pooling` export. Unlike before, these ops do not export an explicit `Pad` op in any situation.\n- Major overhaul to `ConvolutionTranspose` export and import. Attributes such as `output_shape`, `output_padding`, and `pads` are fully supported.\n- Added support for CNTK''s `StopGradient` as a no-op.\n- Added ONNX support for TopK op.\n- Added ONNX support for sequence ops: sequence.slice, sequence.first, sequence.last, sequence.reduce_sum, sequence.reduce_max, sequence.softmax. For these ops, there is no need to expand ONNX spec. CNTK ONNX exporter just builds computation equivalent graphs for these sequence ops.\n- Added full support for Softmax op.\n- Made CNTK broadcast ops compatible with ONNX specification.\n- Handle to_batch, to_sequence, unpack_batch, sequence.unpack ops in CNTK ONNX exporter.\n- ONNX tests to export ONNX test cases for other toolkits to run and to validate.\n- Fixed `Hardmax`/`Softmax`/`LogSoftmax` import/export.\n- Added support for `Select` op export.\n- Added import/export support for several trigonometric ops.\n- Updated CNTK support for ONNX `MatMul` op.\n- Updated CNTK support for ONNX `Gemm` op.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `MeanVarianceNormalization` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `LayerNormalization` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `PRelu` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `Gather` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `ImageScaler` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `Reduce` ops export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `Flatten` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Added CNTK support for ONNX `Unsqueeze` op.\n\n### Bug or minor fixes:\n- Updated LRN op to match ONNX 1.2 spec where the `size` attribute has the semantics of diameter, not radius. Added validation if LRN kernel size is larger than channel size.\n- Updated `Min`/`Max` import implementation to handle variadic inputs.\n- Fixed possible file corruption when resaving on top of existing ONNX model file.\n\n## .Net Support\nThe Cntk.Core.Managed library has officially been converted to .Net Standard and supports .Net Core and .Net Framework applications on both Windows and Linux. Starting from this release, .Net developers should be able to restore CNTK Nuget packages using new .Net SDK style project file with package management format set to PackageReference.\n\nThe following C# code now works on both Windows and Linux:\n\n     >>> var weightParameterName = "weight";\n	 >>> var biasParameterName = "bias";\n	 >>> var inputName = "input";\n	 >>> var outputDim = 2;\n	 >>> var inputDim = 3;\n	 >>> Variable inputVariable = Variable.InputVariable(new int[] { inputDim }, DataType.Float, inputName);\n	 >>> var weightParameter = new Parameter(new int[] { outputDim, inputDim }, DataType.Float, 1, device, weightParameterName);\n	 >>> var biasParameter = new Parameter(new int[] { outputDim }, DataType.Float, 0, device, biasParameterName);\n	 >>> \n     >>> Function modelFunc = CNTKLib.Times(weightParameter, inputVariable) + biasParameter;\n\nFor example, simply adding an ItemGroup clause in the .csproj file of a .Net Core application is sufficient:\n     >>> <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">\n     >>>\n     >>>   <PropertyGroup>\n     >>>     <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\n     >>>     <Platforms>x64</Platforms>\n     >>>   </PropertyGroup>\n     >>>\n     >>>   <ItemGroup>\n     >>>     <PackageReference Include="CNTK.GPU" Version="2.6.0" />\n     >>>   </ItemGroup>\n     >>>\n     >>> </Project>\n\n### Bug or minor fixes:\n- Fixed C# string and char to native wstring and wchar UTF conversion issues on Linux.\n- Fixed multibyte and wide character conversions across the codebase.\n- Fixed Nuget package mechanism to pack for .Net Standard.\n- Fixed a memory leak issue in Value class in C# API where Dispose was not called upon object destruction.\n\n## Misc\n\n\n***2018-04-16.*** CNTK 2.5.1\n\nRepack CNTK 2.5 with third party libraries included in the bundles (Python wheel packages)\n\n---\n\n***2018-03-15.*** CNTK 2.5\n\nChange profiler details output format to be `chrome://tracing`\n\nEnable per-node timing. Working example [here](/Examples/Image/Classification/MLP/Python/SimpleMNIST.py)\n* per-node timing creates items in profiler details when profiler is enabled.\n* usage in Python:\n\n```python\nimport cntk as C\nC.debugging.debug.set_node_timing(True)\nC.debugging.start_profiler() # optional\nC.debugging.enable_profiler() # optional\n#<trainer|evaluator|function> executions\n<trainer|evaluator|function>.print_node_timing()\nC.debugging.stop_profiler()\n```\n\nExample profiler details view in `chrome://tracing`\n![ProfilerDetailWithNodeTiming](https://cntk.ai/Images/ProfilerDetailWithNodeTiming.jpg)\n\nCPU inference performance improvements using MKL\n* Accelerates some common tensor ops in Intel CPU inference for float32, especially for fully connected networks\n* Can be turned on/off by `cntk.cntk_py.enable_cpueval_optimization()/cntk.cntk_py.disable_cpueval_optimization()`\n\n1BitSGD incorporated into CNTK\n* `1BitSGD` source code is now available with CNTK license (MIT license) under `Source/1BitSGD/`\n* `1bitsgd` build target was merged into existing gpu target\n\nNew loss function: hierarchical softmax\n* Thanks @yaochengji for the contribution!\n\nDistributed Training with Multiple Learners\n* Trainer now accepts multiple parameter learners for distributed training. With this change, different parameters of a network can be learned by different learners in a single training session. This also facilitates distributed training for GANs. For more information, please refer to the [Basic_GAN_Distributed.py](/Examples/Image/GAN/Basic_GAN_Distributed.py) and the [cntk.learners.distributed_multi_learner_test.py](/bindings/python/cntk/learners/tests/distributed_multi_learner_test.py)\n\nOperators\n* Added `MeanVarianceNormalization` operator. \n\nBug fixes\n* Fixed convergence issue in Tutorial 201B\n* Fixed pooling/unpooling to support free dimension for sequences\n* Fixed crash in `CNTKBinaryFormat` deserializer when crossing sweep boundary\n* Fixed shape inference bug in RNN step function for scalar broadcasting\n* Fixed a build bug when `mpi=no`\n* Improved distributed training aggregation speed by increasing packing threshold, and expose the knob in V2\n* Fixed a memory leak in MKL layout\n* Fixed a bug in `cntk.convert` API in `misc.converter.py`, which prevents converting complex networks.\n\nONNX\n* Updates\n    * CNTK exported ONNX models are now `ONNX.checker` compliant. \n    * Added ONNX support for CNTK’s `OptimizedRNNStack` operator (LSTM only).\n    * Added support for LSTM and GRU operators\n    * Added support for experimental ONNX op `MeanVarianceNormalization`.\n    * Added support for experimental ONNX op `Identity`.\n    * Added support for exporting CNTK’s `LayerNormalization` layer using ONNX `MeanVarianceNormalization` op.\n* Bug or minor fixes:\n    * Axis attribute is optional in CNTK’s ONNX `Concat` operator.\n    * Bug fix in ONNX broadcasting for scalars.\n    * Bug fix in ONNX ConvTranspose operator. \n    * Backward compatibility bug fix in `LeakyReLu` (argument ‘alpha’ reverted to type double).\n\nMisc\n* Added a new API `find_by_uid()` under `cntk.logging.graph`. \n\n---\n\n***2018-02-28.*** CNTK supports nightly build\n\nIf you prefer to use latest CNTK bits from master, use one of the CNTK nightly package.\n* [Nightly packages for Windows](https://cntk.ai/nightly-windows.html)\n* [Nightly packages for Linux](https://cntk.ai/nightly-linux.html)\n\nAlternatively, you can also click corresponding build badge to land to nightly build page.\n\n---\n\n***2018-01-31.* CNTK 2.4**\n\nHighlights:\n* Moved to CUDA9, cuDNN 7 and Visual Studio 2017.\n* Removed Python 3.4 support.\n* Added Volta GPU and FP16 support.\n* Better ONNX support.\n* CPU perf improvement.\n* More OPs.\n\nOPs\n* `top_k` operation: in the forward pass it computes the top (largest) k values and corresponding indices along the specified axis. In the backward pass the gradient is scattered to the top k elements (an element not in the top k gets a zero gradient).\n* `gather` operation now supports an axis argument\n* `squeeze` and `expand_dims` operations for easily removing and adding singleton axes\n* `zeros_like` and `ones_like` operations. In many situations you can just rely on CNTK correctly broadcasting a simple 0 or 1 but sometimes you need the actual tensor.\n* `depth_to_space`: Rearranges elements in the input tensor from the depth dimension into spatial blocks. Typical use of this operation is for implementing sub-pixel convolution for some image super-resolution models.\n* `space_to_depth`: Rearranges elements in the input tensor from the spatial dimensions to the depth dimension. It is largely the inverse of DepthToSpace.\n* `sum` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes element-wise sum of input tensors.\n* `softsign` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the element-wise softsign of a input tensor.\n* `asinh` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the element-wise asinh of a input tensor.\n* `log_softmax` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the logsoftmax normalized values of a input tensor.\n* `hard_sigmoid` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the hard_sigmoid normalized values of a input tensor.\n* `element_and`, `element_not`, `element_or`, `element_xor` element-wise logic operations\n* `reduce_l1` operation: Computes the L1 norm of the input tensor''s element along the provided axes.\n* `reduce_l2` operation: Computes the L2 norm of the input tensor''s element along the provided axes.\n* `reduce_sum_square` operation: Computes the sum square of the input tensor''s element along the provided axes.\n* `image_scaler` operation: Alteration of image by scaling its individual values.\n\nONNX\n* There have been several improvements to ONNX support in CNTK.\n* Updates\n  * Updated ONNX `Reshape` op to handle `InferredDimension`.\n  * Adding `producer_name` and `producer_version` fields to ONNX models.\n  * Handling the case when neither `auto_pad` nor `pads` atrribute is specified in ONNX `Conv` op.\n* Bug fixes\n  * Fixed bug in ONNX `Pooling` op serialization\n  * Bug fix to create ONNX `InputVariable` with only one batch axis.\n  * Bug fixes and updates to implementation of ONNX `Transpose` op to match updated spec.\n  * Bug fixes and updates to implementation of ONNX `Conv`, `ConvTranspose`, and `Pooling` ops to match updated spec.\n\nOperators\n* Group convolution\n  * Fixed bug in group convolution. Output of CNTK `Convolution` op will change for groups > 1. More optimized implementation of group convolution is expected in the next release.\n  * Better error reporting for group convolution in `Convolution` layer.\n\nHalide Binary Convolution\n- The CNTK build can now use optional [Halide](http://halide-lang.org/) libraries to build `Cntk.BinaryConvolution.so/dll` library that can be used with the `netopt` module. The library contains optimized binary convolution operators that perform better than the python based binarized convolution operators. To enable Halide in the build, please download [Halide release](https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases) and set `HALIDE_PATH` environment varibale before starting a build. In Linux, you can use `./configure --with-halide[=directory]` to enable it. For more information on how to use this feature, please refer to [How_to_use_network_optimization](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Manual/Manual_How_to_use_network_optimizations.ipynb).\n\nSee more in the [Release Notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_4_Release_Notes).\nGet the Release from the [CNTK Releases page](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/releases).\n', '{"language":"C++","stars":17601,"forks":4262,"watchers":17601,"open_issues":839,"topics":["c-plus-plus","c-sharp","cntk","cognitive-toolkit","deep-learning","deep-neural-networks","distributed","java","machine-learning","neural-network","python"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":935217,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Microsoft:CNTK","source_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:lutzroeder:netron","source_url":"https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:halide:Halide","source_url":"https://github.com/halide/Halide"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Microsoft:CNTK","source_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Microsoft:CNTK","source_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK"}]', NULL, 'NOASSERTION', 'approved', 80, 'c6ecf367a378350939a2af57379e79b1', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

This project is a companion project of [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm), which enables universal deployment of LLM across hardware environments.\n\n<div align="center">\n\n**[Check out WebLLM Chat to try it out!](https://chat.webllm.ai/)**\n\n</div>\n\n## Key Features\n- **In-Browser Inference**: WebLLM is a high-performance, in-browser language model inference engine that leverages WebGPU for hardware acceleration, enabling powerful LLM operations directly within web browsers without server-side processing.\n\n- [**Full OpenAI API Compatibility**](#full-openai-compatibility): Seamlessly integrate your app with WebLLM using OpenAI API with functionalities such as streaming, JSON-mode, logit-level control, seeding, and more.\n\n- **Structured JSON Generation**: WebLLM supports state-of-the-art JSON mode structured generation, implemented in the WebAssembly portion of the model library for optimal performance. Check [WebLLM JSON Playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mlc-ai/WebLLM-JSON-Playground) on HuggingFace to try generating JSON output with custom JSON schema.\n\n- [**Extensive Model Support**](#built-in-models): WebLLM natively supports a range of models including Llama 3, Phi 3, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen(通义千问), and many others, making it versatile for various AI tasks. For the complete supported model list, check [MLC Models](https://mlc.ai/models).\n\n- [**Custom Model Integration**](#custom-models): Easily integrate and deploy custom models in MLC format, allowing you to adapt WebLLM to specific needs and scenarios, enhancing flexibility in model deployment.\n\n- **Plug-and-Play Integration**: Easily integrate WebLLM into your projects using package managers like NPM and Yarn, or directly via CDN, complete with comprehensive [examples](./examples/) and a modular design for connecting with UI components.\n\n- **Streaming & Real-Time Interactions**: Supports streaming chat completions, allowing real-time output generation which enhances interactive applications like chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\n- **Web Worker & Service Worker Support**: Optimize UI performance and manage the lifecycle of models efficiently by offloading computations to separate worker threads or service workers.\n\n- **Chrome Extension Support**: Extend the functionality of web browsers through custom Chrome extensions using WebLLM, with examples available for building both basic and advanced extensions.\n\n## Built-in Models\n\nCheck the complete list of available models on [MLC Models](https://mlc.ai/models). WebLLM supports a subset of these available models and the list can be accessed at [`prebuiltAppConfig.model_list`](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/blob/main/src/config.ts#L293).\n\nHere are the primary families of models currently supported:\n\n- **Llama**: Llama 3, Llama 2, Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3\n- **Phi**: Phi 3, Phi 2, Phi 1.5\n- **Gemma**: Gemma-2B\n- **Mistral**: Mistral-7B-v0.3, Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B, NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B, OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B\n- **Qwen (通义千问)**: Qwen2 0.5B, 1.5B, 7B\n\nIf you need more models, [request a new model via opening an issue](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/issues/new/choose) or check [Custom Models](#custom-models) for how to compile and use your own models with WebLLM.\n\n## Jumpstart with Examples\n\nLearn how to use WebLLM to integrate large language models into your application and generate chat completions through this simple Chatbot example: \n\n[![Example Chatbot on JSFiddle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Example-JSFiddle-blue?logo=jsfiddle&logoColor=white)](https://jsfiddle.net/neetnestor/4nmgvsa2/)\n[![Example Chatbot on Codepen](https://img.shields.io/badge/Example-Codepen-gainsboro?logo=codepen)](https://codepen.io/neetnestor/pen/vYwgZaG)\n\nFor an advanced example of a larger, more complicated project, check [WebLLM Chat](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm-chat/blob/main/app/client/webllm.ts).\n\nMore examples for different use cases are available in the [examples](./examples/) folder.\n\n## Get Started\n\nWebLLM offers a minimalist and modular interface to access the chatbot in the browser.\nThe package is designed in a modular way to hook to any of the UI components.\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Package Manager\n\n```sh\n# npm\nnpm install @mlc-ai/web-llm\n# yarn\nyarn add @mlc-ai/web-llm\n# or pnpm\npnpm install @mlc-ai/web-llm\n```\n\nThen import the module in your code.\n\n```typescript\n// Import everything\nimport * as webllm from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n// Or only import what you need\nimport { CreateMLCEngine } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n```\n\n#### CDN Delivery\n\nThanks to [jsdelivr.com](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@mlc-ai/web-llm), WebLLM can be imported directly through URL and work out-of-the-box on cloud development platforms like [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/), [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/), and [Scribbler](https://scribbler.live):\n\n```javascript\nimport * as webllm from "https://esm.run/@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n```\nIt can also be dynamically imported as:\n```javascript\nconst webllm = await import ("https://esm.run/@mlc-ai/web-llm");\n```\n\n### Create MLCEngine\n\nMost operations in WebLLM are invoked through the `MLCEngine` interface. You can create an `MLCEngine` instance and loading the model by calling the `CreateMLCEngine()` factory function.\n\n(Note that loading models requires downloading and it can take a significant amount of time for the very first run without caching previously. You should properly handle this asynchronous call.)\n\n```typescript\nimport { CreateMLCEngine } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n\n// Callback function to update model loading progress\nconst initProgressCallback = (initProgress) => {\n  console.log(initProgress);\n}\nconst selectedModel = "Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC";\n\nconst engine = await CreateMLCEngine(\n  selectedModel,\n  { initProgressCallback: initProgressCallback }, // engineConfig\n);\n```\n\nUnder the hood, this factory function does the following steps for first creating an engine instance (synchronous) and then loading the model (asynchronous). You can also do them separately in your application.\n\n```typescript\nimport { MLCEngine } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n\n// This is a synchronous call that returns immediately\nconst engine = new MLCEngine({\n  initProgressCallback: initProgressCallback\n});\n\n// This is an asynchronous call and can take a long time to finish\nawait engine.reload(selectedModel);\n```\n\n### Chat Completion\nAfter successfully initializing the engine, you can now invoke chat completions using OpenAI style chat APIs through the `engine.chat.completions` interface. For the full list of parameters and their descriptions, check [section below](#full-openai-compatibility) and [OpenAI API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).\n\n(Note: The `model` parameter is not supported and will be ignored here. Instead, call `CreateMLCEngine(model)` or `engine.reload(model)` instead as shown in the [Create MLCEngine](#create-mlcengine) above.)\n\n\n```typescript\nconst messages = [\n  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful AI assistant." },\n  { role: "user", content: "Hello!" },\n]\n\nconst reply = await engine.chat.completions.create({\n  messages,\n});\nconsole.log(reply.choices[0].message);\nconsole.log(reply.usage);\n```\n\n### Streaming\n\nWebLLM also supports streaming chat completion generating. To use it, simply pass `stream: true` to the `engine.chat.completions.create` call.\n\n```typescript\nconst messages = [\n  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful AI assistant." },\n  { role: "user", content: "Hello!" },\n]\n\n// Chunks is an AsyncGenerator object\nconst chunks = await engine.chat.completions.create({\n  messages,\n  temperature: 1,\n  stream: true, // <-- Enable streaming\n  stream_options: { include_usage: true },\n});\n\nlet reply = "";\nfor await (const chunk of chunks) {\n  reply += chunk.choices[0]?.delta.content || "";\n  console.log(reply);\n  if (chunk.usage) {\n    console.log(chunk.usage); // only last chunk has usage\n  }\n}\n\nconst fullReply = await engine.getMessage();\nconsole.log(fullReply);\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Using Workers\n\nYou can put the heavy computation in a worker script to optimize your application performance. To do so, you need to:\n\n1. Create a handler in the worker thread that communicates with the frontend while handling the requests.\n2. Create a Worker Engine in your main application, which under the hood sends messages to the handler in the worker thread.\n\nFor detailed implementations of different kinds of Workers, check the following sections.\n\n#### Dedicated Web Worker\n\nWebLLM comes with API support for WebWorker so you can hook\nthe generation process into a separate worker thread so that\nthe computing in the worker thread won''t disrupt the UI.\n\nWe create a handler in the worker thread that communicates with the frontend while handling the requests.\n\n```typescript\n// worker.ts\nimport { WebWorkerMLCEngineHandler } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n\n// A handler that resides in the worker thread\nconst handler = new WebWorkerMLCEngineHandler();\nself.onmessage = (msg: MessageEvent) => {\n  handler.onmessage(msg);\n};\n```\n\nIn the main logic, we create a `WebWorkerMLCEngine` that\nimplements the same `MLCEngineInterface`. The rest of the logic remains the same.\n\n```typescript\n// main.ts\nimport { CreateWebWorkerMLCEngine } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n\nasync function main() {\n  // Use a WebWorkerMLCEngine instead of MLCEngine here\n  const engine = await CreateWebWorkerMLCEngine(\n    new Worker(\n      new URL("./worker.ts", import.meta.url), \n      {\n        type: "module",\n      }\n    ),\n    selectedModel,\n    { initProgressCallback }, // engineConfig\n  );\n\n  // everything else remains the same\n}\n```\n\n### Use Service Worker\n\nWebLLM comes with API support for ServiceWorker so you can hook the generation process\ninto a service worker to avoid reloading the model in every page visit and optimize\nyour application''s offline experience.\n\n(Note, Service Worker''s life cycle is managed by the browser and can be killed any time without notifying the webapp. `ServiceWorkerMLCEngine` will try to keep the service worker thread alive by periodically sending heartbeat events, but your application should also include proper error handling. Check `keepAliveMs` and `missedHeatbeat` in [`ServiceWorkerMLCEngine`](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/blob/main/src/service_worker.ts#L234) for more details.)\n\nWe create a handler in the worker thread that communicates with the frontend while handling the requests.\n\n\n```typescript\n// sw.ts\nimport { ServiceWorkerMLCEngineHandler } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n\nlet handler: ServiceWorkerMLCEngineHandler;\n\nself.addEventListener("activate", function (event) {\n  handler = new ServiceWorkerMLCEngineHandler();\n  console.log("Service Worker is ready");\n});\n```\n\nThen in the main logic, we register the service worker and create the engine using\n`CreateServiceWorkerMLCEngine` function. The rest of the logic remains the same.\n\n```typescript\n// main.ts\nimport { MLCEngineInterface, CreateServiceWorkerMLCEngine } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n\nif ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register(\n    new URL("sw.ts", import.meta.url),  // worker script\n    { type: "module" },\n  );\n}\n\nconst engine: MLCEngineInterface =\n  await CreateServiceWorkerMLCEngine(\n    selectedModel,\n    { initProgressCallback }, // engineConfig\n  );\n```\n\nYou can find a complete example on how to run WebLLM in service worker in [examples/service-worker](examples/service-worker/).\n\n### Chrome Extension\nYou can also find examples of building Chrome extension with WebLLM in [examples/chrome-extension](examples/chrome-extension/) and [examples/chrome-extension-webgpu-service-worker](examples/chrome-extension-webgpu-service-worker/). The latter one leverages service worker, so the extension is persistent in the background. Additionally, you can explore another full project of a Chrome extension, WebLLM Assistant, which leverages WebLLM [here](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm-assistant).\n\n## Full OpenAI Compatibility\nWebLLM is designed to be fully compatible with [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat). Thus, besides building a simple chatbot, you can also have the following functionalities with WebLLM:\n\n- [streaming](examples/streaming): return output as chunks in real-time in the form of an AsyncGenerator\n- [json-mode](examples/json-mode): efficiently ensure output is in JSON format, see [OpenAI Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api) for more.\n- [seed-to-reproduce](examples/seed-to-reproduce): use seeding to ensure a reproducible output with fields `seed`.\n- [function-calling](examples/function-calling) (WIP): function calling with fields `tools` and `tool_choice` (with preliminary support); or manual function calling without `tools` or `tool_choice` (keeps the most flexibility).\n\n## Custom Models\n\nWebLLM works as a companion project of [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) and it supports custom models in MLC format. \nIt reuses the model artifact and builds the flow of MLC LLM. To compile and use your own models with WebLLM, please check out\n[MLC LLM document](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/webllm.html)\non how to compile and deploy new model weights and libraries to WebLLM. \n\nHere, we go over the high-level idea. There are two elements of the WebLLM package that enable new models and weight variants.\n\n- `model`: Contains a URL to model artifacts, such as weights and meta-data.\n- `model_lib`: A URL to the web assembly library (i.e. wasm file) that contains the executables to accelerate the model computations.\n\nBoth are customizable in the WebLLM.\n\n```typescript\nimport { CreateMLCEngine } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";\n\nasync main() {\n  const appConfig = {\n    "model_list": [\n      {\n        "model": "/url/to/my/llama",\n        "model_id": "MyLlama-3b-v1-q4f32_0",\n        "model_lib": "/url/to/myllama3b.wasm",\n      }\n    ],\n  };\n  // override default\n  const chatOpts = {\n    "repetition_penalty": 1.01\n  };\n\n  // load a prebuilt model\n  // with a chat option override and app config\n  // under the hood, it will load the model from myLlamaUrl\n  // and cache it in the browser cache\n  // The chat will also load the model library from "/url/to/myllama3b.wasm",\n  // assuming that it is compatible to the model in myLlamaUrl.\n  const engine = await CreateMLCEngine(\n    "MyLlama-3b-v1-q4f32_0",\n    { appConfig }, // engineConfig\n    chatOpts,\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn many cases, we only want to supply the model weight variant, but\nnot necessarily a new model (e.g. `NeuralHermes-Mistral` can reuse `Mistral`''s\nmodel library). For examples of how a model library can be shared by different model variants,\nsee `webllm.prebuiltAppConfig`.\n\n## Build WebLLM Package From Source\n\nNOTE: you don''t need to build from source unless you would like to modify the WebLLM package.\nTo use the npm, simply follow [Get Started](#get-started) or any of the [examples](examples) instead.\n\nTo build from source, simply run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen, to test the effects of your code change in an example, inside `examples/get-started/package.json`, change from `"@mlc-ai/web-llm": "^0.2.80"` to `"@mlc-ai/web-llm": ../..`.\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\ncd examples/get-started\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nNote that sometimes you would need to switch between `file:../..` and `../..` to trigger npm to recognize new changes. In the worst case, you can run:\n\n```bash\ncd examples/get-started\nrm -rf node_modules dist package-lock.json .parcel-cache\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\n### In case you need to build TVMjs from source\n\nWebLLM''s runtime largely depends on TVMjs: https://github.com/apache/tvm/tree/main/web\n\nWhile it is also available as an npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mlc-ai/web-runtime, you can build it from source if needed by following the steps below.\n\n1. Install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org). It is an LLVM-based compiler that compiles C/C++ source code to WebAssembly.\n    - Follow the [installation instruction](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions-using-the-emsdk-recommended) to install the latest emsdk.\n    - Source `emsdk_env.sh` by `source path/to/emsdk_env.sh`, so that `emcc` is reachable from PATH and the command `emcc` works.\n\n    We can verify the successful installation by trying out `emcc` terminal.\n\n    Note: We recently found that using the latest `emcc` version may run into issues during runtime. Use `./emsdk install 3.1.56` instead of `./emsdk install latest` for now as a workaround. The error may look like\n    ```\n    Init error, LinkError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Import #6 module="wasi_snapshot_preview1"\n    function="proc_exit": function import requires a callable\n    ```\n\n2. In `./package.json`, change from `"@mlc-ai/web-runtime": "0.18.0-dev2",` to `"@mlc-ai/web-runtime": "file:./tvm_home/web",`.\n\n3. Setup necessary environment\n\n   Prepare all the necessary dependencies for web build:\n\n   ```shell\n   ./scripts/prep_deps.sh\n   ```\n\n   In this step, if `$TVM_SOURCE_DIR` is not defined in the environment, we will execute the following line to build `tvmjs` dependency:\n   ```shell\n   git clone https://github.com/mlc-ai/relax 3rdparty/tvm-unity --recursive\n   ```\n\n   This clones the current HEAD of `mlc-ai/relax`. However, it may not always be the correct branch or commit to clone. To build a specific npm version from source, refer to the version bump PR, which states which branch (i.e. `mlc-ai/relax` or `apache/tvm`) and which commit the current WebLLM version depends on. For instance, version 0.2.52, according to its version bump PR https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/pull/521, is built by checking out the following commit https://github.com/apache/tvm/commit/e6476847753c80e054719ac47bc2091c888418b6 in `apache/tvm`, rather than the HEAD of `mlc-ai/relax`.\n\n   Besides, `--recursive` is necessary and important. Otherwise, you may encounter errors like `fatal error: ''dlpack/dlpack.h'' file not found`.\n\n4. Build WebLLM Package\n\n   ```shell\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n5. Validate some of the sub-packages\n\n   You can then go to the subfolders in [examples](examples) to validate some of the sub-packages.\n   We use Parcelv2 for bundling. Although Parcel is not very good at tracking parent directory\n   changes sometimes. When you make a change in the WebLLM package, try to edit the `package.json`\n   of the subfolder and save it, which will trigger Parcel to rebuild.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Demo App: WebLLM Chat](https://chat.webllm.ai/)\n- If you want to run LLM on native runtime, check out [MLC-LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm)\n- You might also be interested in [Web Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-stable-diffusion/).\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis project is initiated by members from CMU Catalyst, UW SAMPL, SJTU, OctoML, and the MLC community.

We usually\nrun either on Cloud TPUs or on 8-GPU machines; you might need\nto modify the hyperparameters if you run on a different setup.\n\n### Mathematical Language Understanding\n\nFor evaluating mathematical expressions at the character level involving addition, subtraction and multiplication of both positive and negative decimal numbers with variable digits assigned to symbolic variables, use\n\n* the [MLU](https://art.wangperawong.com/mathematical_language_understanding_train.tar.gz) data-set:\n `--problem=algorithmic_math_two_variables`\n\nYou can try solving the problem with different transformer models and hyperparameters as described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02825):\n* Standard transformer:\n`--model=transformer`\n`--hparams_set=transformer_tiny`\n* Universal transformer:\n`--model=universal_transformer`\n`--hparams_set=universal_transformer_tiny`\n* Adaptive universal transformer:\n`--model=universal_transformer`\n`--hparams_set=adaptive_universal_transformer_tiny`\n\n### Story, Question and Answer\n\nFor answering questions based on a story, use\n\n* the [bAbi](https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/) data-set:\n `--problem=babi_qa_concat_task1_1k`\n\nYou can choose the bAbi task from the range [1,20] and the subset from 1k or\n10k. To combine test data from all tasks into a single test set, use\n`--problem=babi_qa_concat_all_tasks_10k`\n\n### Image Classification\n\nFor image classification, we have a number of standard data-sets:\n\n* ImageNet (a large data-set): `--problem=image_imagenet`, or one\n   of the re-scaled versions (`image_imagenet224`, `image_imagenet64`,\n   `image_imagenet32`)\n* CIFAR-10: `--problem=image_cifar10` (or\n    `--problem=image_cifar10_plain` to turn off data augmentation)\n* CIFAR-100: `--problem=image_cifar100`\n* MNIST: `--problem=image_mnist`\n\nFor ImageNet, we suggest to use the ResNet or Xception, i.e.,\nuse `--model=resnet --hparams_set=resnet_50` or\n`--model=xception --hparams_set=xception_base`.\nResnet should get to above 76% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\n\nFor CIFAR and MNIST, we suggest to try the shake-shake model:\n`--model=shake_shake --hparams_set=shakeshake_big`.\nThis setting trained for `--train_steps=700000` should yield\nclose to 97% accuracy on CIFAR-10.\n\n### Image Generation\n\nFor (un)conditional image generation, we have a number of standard data-sets:\n\n* CelebA: `--problem=img2img_celeba` for image-to-image translation, namely,\n    superresolution from 8x8 to 32x32.\n* CelebA-HQ: `--problem=image_celeba256_rev` for a downsampled 256x256.\n* CIFAR-10: `--problem=image_cifar10_plain_gen_rev` for class-conditional\n    32x32 generation.\n* LSUN Bedrooms: `--problem=image_lsun_bedrooms_rev`\n* MS-COCO: `--problem=image_text_ms_coco_rev` for text-to-image generation.\n* Small ImageNet (a large data-set): `--problem=image_imagenet32_gen_rev` for\n    32x32 or `--problem=image_imagenet64_gen_rev` for 64x64.\n\nWe suggest to use the Image Transformer, i.e., `--model=imagetransformer`, or\nthe Image Transformer Plus, i.e., `--model=imagetransformerpp` that uses\ndiscretized mixture of logistics, or variational auto-encoder, i.e.,\n`--model=transformer_ae`.\nFor CIFAR-10, using `--hparams_set=imagetransformer_cifar10_base` or\n`--hparams_set=imagetransformer_cifar10_base_dmol` yields 2.90 bits per\ndimension. For Imagenet-32, using\n`--hparams_set=imagetransformer_imagenet32_base` yields 3.77 bits per dimension.\n\n### Language Modeling\n\nFor language modeling, we have these data-sets in T2T:\n\n* PTB (a small data-set): `--problem=languagemodel_ptb10k` for\n    word-level modeling and `--problem=languagemodel_ptb_characters`\n    for character-level modeling.\n* LM1B (a billion-word corpus): `--problem=languagemodel_lm1b32k` for\n    subword-level modeling and `--problem=languagemodel_lm1b_characters`\n    for character-level modeling.\n\nWe suggest to start with `--model=transformer` on this task and use\n`--hparams_set=transformer_small` for PTB and\n`--hparams_set=transformer_base` for LM1B.\n\n### Sentiment Analysis\n\nFor the task of recognizing the sentiment of a sentence, use\n\n* the IMDB data-set: `--problem=sentiment_imdb`\n\nWe suggest to use `--model=transformer_encoder` here and since it is\na small data-set, try `--hparams_set=transformer_tiny` and train for\nfew steps (e.g., `--train_steps=2000`).\n\n### Speech Recognition\n\nFor speech-to-text, we have these data-sets in T2T:\n\n* Librispeech (US English): `--problem=librispeech` for\n    the whole set and `--problem=librispeech_clean` for a smaller\n    but nicely filtered part.\n\n* Mozilla Common Voice (US English): `--problem=common_voice` for the whole set\n    `--problem=common_voice_clean` for a quality-checked subset.\n\n### Summarization\n\nFor summarizing longer text into shorter one we have these data-sets:\n\n* CNN/DailyMail articles summarized into a few sentences:\n  `--problem=summarize_cnn_dailymail32k`\n\nWe suggest to use `--model=transformer` and\n`--hparams_set=transformer_prepend` for this task.\nThis yields good ROUGE scores.\n\n### Translation\n\nThere are a number of translation data-sets in T2T:\n\n* English-German: `--problem=translate_ende_wmt32k`\n* English-French: `--problem=translate_enfr_wmt32k`\n* English-Czech: `--problem=translate_encs_wmt32k`\n* English-Chinese: `--problem=translate_enzh_wmt32k`\n* English-Vietnamese: `--problem=translate_envi_iwslt32k`\n* English-Spanish: `--problem=translate_enes_wmt32k`\n\nYou can get translations in the other direction by appending `_rev` to\nthe problem name, e.g., for German-English use\n`--problem=translate_ende_wmt32k_rev`\n(note that you still need to download the original data with t2t-datagen\n`--problem=translate_ende_wmt32k`).\n\nFor all translation problems, we suggest to try the Transformer model:\n`--model=transformer`. At first it is best to try the base setting,\n`--hparams_set=transformer_base`. When trained on 8 GPUs for 300K steps\nthis should reach a BLEU score of about 28 on the English-German data-set,\nwhich is close to state-of-the art. If training on a single GPU, try the\n`--hparams_set=transformer_base_single_gpu` setting. For very good results\nor larger data-sets (e.g., for English-French), try the big model\nwith `--hparams_set=transformer_big`.\n\nSee this [example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/notebooks/Transformer_translate.ipynb) to know how the translation works.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Walkthrough\n\nHere''s a walkthrough training a good English-to-German translation\nmodel using the Transformer model from [*Attention Is All You\nNeed*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) on WMT data.\n\n```\npip install tensor2tensor\n\n# See what problems, models, and hyperparameter sets are available.\n# You can easily swap between them (and add new ones).\nt2t-trainer --registry_help\n\nPROBLEM=translate_ende_wmt32k\nMODEL=transformer\nHPARAMS=transformer_base_single_gpu\n\nDATA_DIR=$HOME/t2t_data\nTMP_DIR=/tmp/t2t_datagen\nTRAIN_DIR=$HOME/t2t_train/$PROBLEM/$MODEL-$HPARAMS\n\nmkdir -p $DATA_DIR $TMP_DIR $TRAIN_DIR\n\n# Generate data\nt2t-datagen \\n  --data_dir=$DATA_DIR \\n  --tmp_dir=$TMP_DIR \\n  --problem=$PROBLEM\n\n# Train\n# *  If you run out of memory, add --hparams=''batch_size=1024''.\nt2t-trainer \\n  --data_dir=$DATA_DIR \\n  --problem=$PROBLEM \\n  --model=$MODEL \\n  --hparams_set=$HPARAMS \\n  --output_dir=$TRAIN_DIR\n\n# Decode\n\nDECODE_FILE=$DATA_DIR/decode_this.txt\necho "Hello world" >> $DECODE_FILE\necho "Goodbye world" >> $DECODE_FILE\necho -e ''Hallo Welt\nAuf Wiedersehen Welt'' > ref-translation.de\n\nBEAM_SIZE=4\nALPHA=0.6\n\nt2t-decoder \\n  --data_dir=$DATA_DIR \\n  --problem=$PROBLEM \\n  --model=$MODEL \\n  --hparams_set=$HPARAMS \\n  --output_dir=$TRAIN_DIR \\n  --decode_hparams="beam_size=$BEAM_SIZE,alpha=$ALPHA" \\n  --decode_from_file=$DECODE_FILE \\n  --decode_to_file=translation.en\n\n# See the translations\ncat translation.en\n\n# Evaluate the BLEU score\n# Note: Report this BLEU score in papers, not the internal approx_bleu metric.\nt2t-bleu --translation=translation.en --reference=ref-translation.de\n```\n\n### Installation\n\n\n```\n# Assumes tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu installed\npip install tensor2tensor\n\n# Installs with tensorflow-gpu requirement\npip install tensor2tensor[tensorflow_gpu]\n\n# Installs with tensorflow (cpu) requirement\npip install tensor2tensor[tensorflow]\n```\n\nBinaries:\n\n```\n# Data generator\nt2t-datagen\n\n# Trainer\nt2t-trainer --registry_help\n```\n\nLibrary usage:\n\n```\npython -c "from tensor2tensor.models.transformer import Transformer"\n```\n\n### Features\n\n* Many state of the art and baseline models are built-in and new models can be\n  added easily (open an issue or pull request!).\n* Many datasets across modalities - text, audio, image - available for\n  generation and use, and new ones can be added easily (open an issue or pull\n  request for public datasets!).\n* Models can be used with any dataset and input mode (or even multiple); all\n  modality-specific processing (e.g. embedding lookups for text tokens) is done\n  with `bottom` and `top` transformations, which are specified per-feature in the\n  model.\n* Support for multi-GPU machines and synchronous (1 master, many workers) and\n  asynchronous (independent workers synchronizing through a parameter server)\n  [distributed training](https://tensorflow.github.io/tensor2tensor/distributed_training.html).\n* Easily swap amongst datasets and models by command-line flag with the data\n  generation script `t2t-datagen` and the training script `t2t-trainer`.\n* Train on [Google Cloud ML](https://tensorflow.github.io/tensor2tensor/cloud_mlengine.html) and [Cloud TPUs](https://tensorflow.github.io/tensor2tensor/cloud_tpu.html).\n\n## T2T overview\n\n### Problems\n\n**Problems** consist of features such as inputs and targets, and metadata such\nas each feature''s modality (e.g. symbol, image, audio) and vocabularies. Problem\nfeatures are given by a dataset, which is stored as a `TFRecord` file with\n`tensorflow.Example` protocol buffers. All\nproblems are imported in\n[`all_problems.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/data_generators/all_problems.py)\nor are registered with `@registry.register_problem`. Run\n[`t2t-datagen`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/bin/t2t-datagen)\nto see the list of available problems and download them.\n\n### Models\n\n**`T2TModel`s** define the core tensor-to-tensor computation. They apply a\ndefault transformation to each input and output so that models may deal with\nmodality-independent tensors (e.g. embeddings at the input; and a linear\ntransform at the output to produce logits for a softmax over classes). All\nmodels are imported in the\n[`models` subpackage](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/models/__init__.py),\ninherit from [`T2TModel`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/utils/t2t_model.py),\nand are registered with\n[`@registry.register_model`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/utils/registry.py).\n\n### Hyperparameter Sets\n\n**Hyperparameter sets** are encoded in\n[`HParams`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/utils/hparam.py)\nobjects, and are registered with\n[`@registry.register_hparams`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/utils/registry.py).\nEvery model and problem has a `HParams`. A basic set of hyperparameters are\ndefined in\n[`common_hparams.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/layers/common_hparams.py)\nand hyperparameter set functions can compose other hyperparameter set functions.\n\n### Trainer\n\nThe **trainer** binary is the entrypoint for training, evaluation, and\ninference. Users can easily switch between problems, models, and hyperparameter\nsets by using the `--model`, `--problem`, and `--hparams_set` flags. Specific\nhyperparameters can be overridden with the `--hparams` flag. `--schedule` and\nrelated flags control local and distributed training/evaluation\n([distributed training documentation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/docs/distributed_training.md)).\n\n## Adding your own components\n\nT2T''s components are registered using a central registration mechanism that\nenables easily adding new ones and easily swapping amongst them by command-line\nflag. You can add your own components without editing the T2T codebase by\nspecifying the `--t2t_usr_dir` flag in `t2t-trainer`.\n\nYou can do so for models, hyperparameter sets, modalities, and problems. Please\ndo submit a pull request if your component might be useful to others.\n\nSee the [`example_usr_dir`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/test_data/example_usr_dir)\nfor an example user directory.\n\n## Adding a dataset\n\nTo add a new dataset, subclass\n[`Problem`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/data_generators/problem.py)\nand register it with `@registry.register_problem`. See\n[`TranslateEndeWmt8k`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/data_generators/translate_ende.py)\nfor an example. Also see the [data generators\nREADME](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/data_generators/README.md).\n\n## Run on FloydHub\n\n[![Run on FloydHub](https://static.floydhub.com/button/button.svg)](https://floydhub.com/run)\n\nClick this button to open a [Workspace](https://blog.floydhub.com/workspaces/) on [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=tensor2tensor&utm_campaign=jul_2018).

At least one beginner machine learning course (however this might be able to be skipped, resources are linked for many different topics).\n3. Experience using Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab (though you can pick this up as we go along).\n4. A willingness to learn (most important).\n\nFor 1 & 2, I''d recommend the [Zero to Mastery Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://dbourke.link/ZTMMLcourse), it''ll teach you the fundamentals of machine learning and Python (I''m biased though, I also teach that course).\n\n### How is the course taught?\n\nAll of the course materials are available for free in an online book at [learnpytorch.io](https://learnpytorch.io). If you like to read, I''d recommend going through the resources there.\n\nIf you prefer to learn via video, the course is also taught in apprenticeship-style format, meaning I write PyTorch code, you write PyTorch code.\n\nThere''s a reason the course motto''s include *if in doubt, run the code* and *experiment, experiment, experiment!*.\n\nMy whole goal is to help you to do one thing: learn machine learning by writing PyTorch code.\n\nThe code is all written via [Google Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com) (you could also use Jupyter Notebooks), an incredible free resource to experiment with machine learning.\n\n### What will I get if I finish the course?\n\nThere''s certificates and all that jazz if you go through the videos.\n\nBut certificates are meh.\n\nYou can consider this course a machine learning momentum builder.\n\nBy the end, you''ll have written hundreds of lines of PyTorch code.\n\nAnd will have been exposed to many of the most important concepts in machine learning.\n\nSo when you go to build your own machine learning projects or inspect a public machine learning project made with PyTorch, it''ll feel familiar and if it doesn''t, at least you''ll know where to look.\n\n### What will I build in the course?\n\nWe start with the barebone fundamentals of PyTorch and machine learning, so even if you''re new to machine learning you''ll be caught up to speed.\n\nThen we’ll explore more advanced areas including PyTorch neural network classification, PyTorch workflows, computer vision, custom datasets, experiment tracking, model deployment, and my personal favourite: transfer learning, a powerful technique for taking what one machine learning model has learned on another problem and applying it to your own!\n\nAlong the way, you’ll build three milestone projects surrounding an overarching project called FoodVision, a neural network computer vision model to classify images of food. \n\nThese milestone projects will help you practice using PyTorch to cover important machine learning concepts and create a portfolio you can show employers and say "here''s what I''ve done".\n\n### How do I get started?\n\nYou can read the materials on any device but this course is best viewed and coded along within a desktop browser.\n\nThe course uses a free tool called Google Colab. If you''ve got no experience with it, I''d go through the free [Introduction to Google Colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) and then come back here.\n\nTo start:\n\n1. Click on one of the notebook or section links above like "[00. PyTorch Fundamentals](https://www.learnpytorch.io/00_pytorch_fundamentals/)". \n2. Click the "Open in Colab" button up the top.\n3. Press SHIFT+Enter a few times and see what happens.\n\n### My question isn''t answered \n\nPlease leave a [discussion](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/discussions) or send me an email directly: daniel (at) mrdbourke (dot) com.\n\n## Log\n\nAlmost daily updates of what''s happening.\n\n* 15 May 2023 - PyTorch 2.0 tutorial finished + videos added to ZTM/Udemy, see code: https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_2_intro/\n* 13 Apr 2023 - update PyTorch 2.0 notebook\n* 30 Mar 2023 - update PyTorch 2.0 notebook with more info/clean code\n* 23 Mar 2023 - upgrade PyTorch 2.0 tutorial with annotations and images\n* 13 Mar 2023 - add starter code for PyTorch 2.0 tutorial \n* 18 Nov 2022 - add a reference for 3 most common errors in PyTorch + links to course sections for more: https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_most_common_errors/ \n* 9 Nov 2022 - add PyTorch cheatsheet for a very quick overview of the main features of PyTorch + links to course sections: https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_cheatsheet/ \n* 9 Nov 2022 - full course materials (300+ videos) are now live on Udemy!

It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.\n\nTensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015.\n\n\n============\nMotivation\n============\n\nThere are different motivations for this open source project. TensorFlow (as we write this document) is one of / the best deep learning frameworks available. The question that should be asked is why has this repository been created when there are so many other tutorials about TensorFlow available on the web?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhy use TensorFlow?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDeep Learning is in very high interest these days - there''s a crucial need for rapid and optimized implementations of the algorithms and architectures. TensorFlow is designed to facilitate this goal.\n\nThe strong advantage of TensorFlow is it flexibility in designing highly modular models which can also be a disadvantage for beginners since a lot of the pieces must be considered together when creating the model.\n\nThis issue has been facilitated as well by developing high-level APIs such as `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_ and `Slim <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/031a5a4ab41170d555bc3e8f8545cf9c8e3f1b28/research/inception/inception/slim/README.md>`_ which abstract a lot of the pieces used in designing machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe interesting thing about TensorFlow is that **it can be found anywhere these days**. Lots of the researchers and developers are using it and *its community is growing at the speed of light*! So many issues can be dealt with easily since they''re usually the same issues that a lot of other people run into considering the large number of people involved in the TensorFlow community.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhat''s the point of this repository?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Developing open source projects for the sake of just developing something is not the reason behind this effort**.\nConsidering the large number of tutorials that are being added to this large community, this repository has been created to break the jump-in and jump-out process that usually happens to most of the open source projects, **but why and how**?\n\nFirst of all, what''s the point of putting effort into something that most of the people won''t stop by and take a look? What''s the point of creating something that does not help anyone in the developers and researchers community? Why spend time for something that can easily be forgotten? But **how we try to do it?** Even up to this\nvery moment there are countless tutorials on TensorFlow whether on the model design or TensorFlow\nworkflow.\n\nMost of them are too complicated or suffer from a lack of documentation. There are only a few available tutorials which are concise and well-structured and provide enough insight for their specific implemented models.\n\nThe goal of this project is to help the community with structured tutorials and simple and optimized code implementations to provide better insight about how to use TensorFlow *quick and effectively*.\n\nIt is worth noting that, **the main goal of this project is to provide well-documented tutorials and less-complicated code**!\n\n=================================================\nTensorFlow Installation and Setup the Environment\n=================================================\n\n\n.. image:: _img/mainpage/installation-logo.gif\n   :height: 100px\n   :width: 200 px\n   :scale: 50 %\n   :alt: alternate text\n   :align: right\n   :target: docs/tutorials/installation\n\n.. _TensorFlow Installation: https://www.tensorflow.org/install\n\nIn order to install TensorFlow please refer to the following link:\n\n  * `TensorFlow Installation`_\n\n\n.. image:: _img/mainpage/installation.gif\n    :target: https://www.tensorflow.org/install\n\nThe virtual environment installation is recommended in order to prevent package conflict and having the capacity to customize the working environment.\n\n====================\nTensorFlow Tutorials\n====================\n\nThe tutorials in this repository are partitioned into relevant categories.\n\n==========================\n\n~~~~~~~~\nWarm-up\n~~~~~~~~\n\n.. image:: _img/mainpage/welcome.gif\n   :height: 100px\n   :width: 200 px\n   :scale: 50 %\n   :alt: alternate text\n   :align: right\n\n\n.. _colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/instillai/TensorFlow-Course/blob/master/codes/ipython/0-welcome/welcome.ipynb\n.. _Documentationcnnwelcome: docs/tutorials/0-welcome\n.. _ipythonwelcome: codes/ipython/0-welcome/welcome.ipynb\n.. _pythonwelcome: https://github.com/instillai/TensorFlow-Course/blob/master/codes/python/0-welcome/welcome.py\n.. _videowelcome: https://youtu.be/xd0DVygHlNE\n\n\n.. |Welcome| image:: https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\n   :target: https://colab.research.google.com/github/instillai/TensorFlow-Course/blob/master/codes/ipython/0-welcome/welcome.ipynb\n\n.. |youtubeim| image:: _img/mainpage/YouTube.png\n  :target: https://github.com/instillai/TensorFlow-Course/blob/master/_img/mainpage/YouTube.png\n\n\n+----+---------------------+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\n| #

Currently, we have over 100 figures (all open community contributions). You are free to use the visuals in your machine learning presentations or blog posts. You don’t need to ask permission to use any of the visuals but it will be nice if you can provide credit to the designer/author (author information found in the slide notes). Check out the versions of the visuals below. \n\nThis is a project made by the [dair.ai](https://dair.ai/) community. The latest version of the Google slides can be found in this GitHub repository. Our community members will continue to add more common figures and basic elements in upcoming versions. Think of this as free and open artifacts and templates which you can freely and easily download, copy, distribute, reuse and customize to your own needs.\n\nML Visuals is now being used to power 100s of figures used by master/PhD students, papers (like this [one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05113)), among other use cases. \n\n## How to Use?\n\nEssentially, we are using Google Slides to maintain all visuals and figures (check the versions below). To add your own custom figures, simply add a new slide and reuse any of the basic visual components (remember to request edit permissions). You can also create your own copy of the slides and customize whatever you like. We encourage authors/designers to add their visuals here and allow others to reuse them. Make sure to include your author information (in the notes section of the slide) so that others can provide credit if they use the visuals elsewhere (e.g. blog/presentations). Also, provide a short description of your visual to help the user understand what it is about and how they can use it. If you need "Edit" permission, just click on the "request edit access" option under the "view only" toolbar (in Google Slides) or send me an email at ellfae@gmail.com.\n\nDownloading a figure from any of the slides is easy. Just click on File→Download→(choose your format).\n\nIf you need help with customizing a figure or have an idea of something that could be valuable to others, we can help. Just open an issue [here](https://github.com/dair-ai/ml-visuals/issues/new) and we will do our best to come up with the visual.

It offers multiple ways to engage with and leverage our AI agents. This is the interface where you''ll bring your AI automation ideas to life:\n\n   **Agent Builder:** For those who want to customize, our intuitive, low-code interface allows you to design and configure your own AI agents. \n   \n   **Workflow Management:** Build, modify, and optimize your automation workflows with ease. You build your agent by connecting blocks, where each block     performs a single action.\n   \n   **Deployment Controls:** Manage the lifecycle of your agents, from testing to production.\n   \n   **Ready-to-Use Agents:** Don''t want to build? Simply select from our library of pre-configured agents and put them to work immediately.\n   \n   **Agent Interaction:** Whether you''ve built your own or are using pre-configured agents, easily run and interact with them through our user-friendly      interface.\n\n   **Monitoring and Analytics:** Keep track of your agents'' performance and gain insights to continually improve your automation processes.\n\n[Read this guide](https://docs.agpt.co/platform/new_blocks/) to learn how to build your own custom blocks.\n\n### 💽 AutoGPT Server\n\nThe AutoGPT Server is the powerhouse of our platform This is where your agents run. Once deployed, agents can be triggered by external sources and can operate continuously. It contains all the essential components that make AutoGPT run smoothly.\n\n   **Source Code:** The core logic that drives our agents and automation processes.\n   \n   **Infrastructure:** Robust systems that ensure reliable and scalable performance.\n   \n   **Marketplace:** A comprehensive marketplace where you can find and deploy a wide range of pre-built agents.\n\n### 🐙 Example Agents\n\nHere are two examples of what you can do with AutoGPT:\n\n1. **Generate Viral Videos from Trending Topics**\n   - This agent reads topics on Reddit.\n   - It identifies trending topics.\n   - It then automatically creates a short-form video based on the content. \n\n2. **Identify Top Quotes from Videos for Social Media**\n   - This agent subscribes to your YouTube channel.\n   - When you post a new video, it transcribes it.\n   - It uses AI to identify the most impactful quotes to generate a summary.\n   - Then, it writes a post to automatically publish to your social media. \n\nThese examples show just a glimpse of what you can achieve with AutoGPT! You can create customized workflows to build agents for any use case.\n\n---\n\n### **License Overview:**\n\n🛡️ **Polyform Shield License:**\nAll code and content within the `autogpt_platform` folder is licensed under the Polyform Shield License.

While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. ''node-'' in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and ''-mation'' for ''automation'' which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI.

It helps you chain together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI application development – all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying technology evolves.\n\n```bash\npip install langchain\n```\n\nIf you''re looking for more advanced customization or agent orchestration, check out [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview), our framework for building controllable agent workflows.\n\n---\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- [docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview) – Comprehensive documentation, including conceptual overviews and guides\n- [reference.langchain.com/python](https://reference.langchain.com/python) – API reference docs for LangChain packages\n\n**Discussions**: Visit the [LangChain Forum](https://forum.langchain.com) to connect with the community and share all of your technical questions, ideas, and feedback.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Looking for the JS/TS library? Check out [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs).\n\n## Why use LangChain?\n\nLangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.\n\nUse LangChain for:\n\n- **Real-time data augmentation**. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external/internal systems, drawing from LangChain''s vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.\n- **Model interoperability**. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application''s needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly – LangChain''s abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum.\n- **Rapid prototyping**. Quickly build and iterate on LLM applications with LangChain''s modular, component-based architecture. Test different approaches and workflows without rebuilding from scratch, accelerating your development cycle.\n- **Production-ready features**. Deploy reliable applications with built-in support for monitoring, evaluation, and debugging through integrations like LangSmith. Scale with confidence using battle-tested patterns and best practices.\n- **Vibrant community and ecosystem**. Leverage a rich ecosystem of integrations, templates, and community-contributed components. Benefit from continuous improvements and stay up-to-date with the latest AI developments through an active open-source community.\n- **Flexible abstraction layers**. Work at the level of abstraction that suits your needs - from high-level chains for quick starts to low-level components for fine-grained control. LangChain grows with your application''s complexity.\n\n## LangChain ecosystem\n\nWhile the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM applications.\n\nTo improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with:\n\n- [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview) – Build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework.

Thank you!\n\n## How to Install 🚀\n\n### Installation via Python pip 🐍\n\nOpen WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you''re using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.\n\n1. **Install Open WebUI**:\n   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install open-webui\n   ```\n\n2. **Running Open WebUI**:\n   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:\n\n   ```bash\n   open-webui serve\n   ```\n\nThis will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\n\n### Quick Start with Docker 🐳\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.\n\n> [!TIP]  \n> If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.\n\n### Installation with Default Configuration\n\n- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:\n\n  ```bash\n  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main\n  ```\n\n- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:\n\n  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server''s URL:\n\n  ```bash\n  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main\n  ```\n\n- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:\n\n  ```bash\n  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda\n  ```\n\n### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only\n\n- **If you''re only using OpenAI API**, use this command:\n\n  ```bash\n  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main\n  ```\n\n### Installing Open WebUI with Bundled Ollama Support\n\nThis installation method uses a single container image that bundles Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command. Choose the appropriate command based on your hardware setup:\n\n- **With GPU Support**:\n  Utilize GPU resources by running the following command:\n\n  ```bash\n  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama\n  ```\n\n- **For CPU Only**:\n  If you''re not using a GPU, use this command instead:\n\n  ```bash\n  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama\n  ```\n\nBoth commands facilitate a built-in, hassle-free installation of both Open WebUI and Ollama, ensuring that you can get everything up and running swiftly.\n\nAfter installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄\n\n### Other Installation Methods\n\nWe offer various installation alternatives, including non-Docker native installation methods, Docker Compose, Kustomize, and Helm. Visit our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s) for comprehensive guidance.\n\nLook at the [Local Development Guide](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/advanced-topics/development) for instructions on setting up a local development environment.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nEncountering connection issues? Our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/) has got you covered. For further assistance and to join our vibrant community, visit the [Open WebUI Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).\n\n#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error\n\nIf you''re experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n**Example Docker Command**:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main\n```\n\n### Keeping Your Docker Installation Up-to-Date\n\nIn case you want to update your local Docker installation to the latest version, you can do it with [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/):\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui\n```\n\nIn the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.\n\nCheck our Updating Guide available in our [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/updating).\n\n### Using the Dev Branch 🌙\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> The `:dev` branch contains the latest unstable features and changes. Use it at your own risk as it may have bugs or incomplete features.\n\nIf you want to try out the latest bleeding-edge features and are okay with occasional instability, you can use the `:dev` tag like this:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev\n```\n\n### Offline Mode\n\nIf you are running Open WebUI in an offline environment, you can set the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` environment variable to `1` to prevent attempts to download models from the internet.\n\n```bash\nexport HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1\n```\n\n## What''s Next? 🌟\n\nDiscover upcoming features on our roadmap in the [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/roadmap/).\n\n## License 📜\n\nThis project contains code under multiple licenses.

There are three interconnected repositories:\n\n1. **[ComfyUI Core](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)**\n   - Releases a new stable version (e.g., v0.7.0) roughly every week.\n   - Commits outside of the stable release tags may be very unstable and break many custom nodes.\n   - Serves as the foundation for the desktop release\n\n2. **[ComfyUI Desktop](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop)**\n   - Builds a new release using the latest stable core version\n\n3. **[ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend)**\n   - Weekly frontend updates are merged into the core repository\n   - Features are frozen for the upcoming core release\n   - Development continues for the next release cycle\n\n## Shortcuts\n\n| Keybind

Installing\n\n## Windows Portable\n\nThere is a portable standalone build for Windows that should work for running on Nvidia GPUs or for running on your CPU only on the [releases page](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases).\n\n### [Direct link to download](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z)\n\nSimply download, extract with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) or with the windows explorer on recent windows versions and run. For smaller models you normally only need to put the checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints but many of the larger models have multiple files. Make sure to follow the instructions to know which subfolder to put them in ComfyUI\models\\n\nIf you have trouble extracting it, right click the file -> properties -> unblock\n\nUpdate your Nvidia drivers if it doesn''t start.\n\n#### Alternative Downloads:\n\n[Experimental portable for AMD GPUs](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_amd.7z)\n\n[Portable with pytorch cuda 12.8 and python 3.12](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu128.7z).\n\n[Portable with pytorch cuda 12.6 and python 3.12](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu126.7z) (Supports Nvidia 10 series and older GPUs).\n\n#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?\n\nSee the [Config file](extra_model_paths.yaml.example) to set the search paths for models. In the standalone windows build you can find this file in the ComfyUI directory. Rename this file to extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.\n\n\n## [comfy-cli](https://docs.comfy.org/comfy-cli/getting-started)\n\nYou can install and start ComfyUI using comfy-cli:\n```bash\npip install comfy-cli\ncomfy install\n```\n\n## Manual Install (Windows, Linux)\n\nPython 3.14 works but you may encounter issues with the torch compile node. The free threaded variant is still missing some dependencies.\n\nPython 3.13 is very well supported. If you have trouble with some custom node dependencies on 3.13 you can try 3.12\n\n### Instructions:\n\nGit clone this repo.\n\nPut your SD checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: models/checkpoints\n\nPut your VAE in: models/vae\n\n\n### AMD GPUs (Linux)\n\nAMD users can install rocm and pytorch with pip if you don''t have it already installed, this is the command to install the stable version:\n\n```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4```\n\nThis is the command to install the nightly with ROCm 7.0 which might have some performance improvements:\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.1```\n\n\n### AMD GPUs (Experimental: Windows and Linux), RDNA 3, 3.5 and 4 only.\n\nThese have less hardware support than the builds above but they work on windows. You also need to install the pytorch version specific to your hardware.\n\nRDNA 3 (RX 7000 series):\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx110X-dgpu/```\n\nRDNA 3.5 (Strix halo/Ryzen AI Max+ 365):\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx1151/```\n\nRDNA 4 (RX 9000 series):\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx120X-all/```\n\n### Intel GPUs (Windows and Linux)\n\nIntel Arc GPU users can install native PyTorch with torch.xpu support using pip. More information can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html)\n\n1. To install PyTorch xpu, use the following command:\n\n```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu```\n\nThis is the command to install the Pytorch xpu nightly which might have some performance improvements:\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/xpu```\n\n### NVIDIA\n\nNvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:\n\n```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130```\n\nThis is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements.\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130```\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you get the "Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled" error, uninstall torch with:\n\n```pip uninstall torch```\n\nAnd install it again with the command above.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nInstall the dependencies by opening your terminal inside the ComfyUI folder and:\n\n```pip install -r requirements.txt```\n\nAfter this you should have everything installed and can proceed to running ComfyUI.\n\n### Others:\n\n#### Apple Mac silicon\n\nYou can install ComfyUI in Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2) with any recent macOS version.\n\n1. Install pytorch nightly. For instructions, read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly).\n1. Follow the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) instructions for Windows and Linux.\n1. Install the ComfyUI [dependencies](#dependencies). If you have another Stable Diffusion UI [you might be able to reuse the dependencies](#i-already-have-another-ui-for-stable-diffusion-installed-do-i-really-have-to-install-all-of-these-dependencies).\n1. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`\n\n> **Note**: Remember to add your models, VAE, LoRAs etc. to the corresponding Comfy folders, as discussed in [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux).\n\n#### Ascend NPUs\n\nFor models compatible with Ascend Extension for PyTorch (torch_npu). To get started, ensure your environment meets the prerequisites outlined on the [installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/ascend/quick_install.html) page.

Proceed with the installation of Ascend Basekit, which includes the driver, firmware, and CANN, following the instructions provided for your specific platform.\n3. Next, install the necessary packages for torch-npu by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/pytorch/install.html#pytorch) page.\n4. Finally, adhere to the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) guide for Linux. Once all components are installed, you can run ComfyUI as described earlier.\n\n#### Cambricon MLUs\n\nFor models compatible with Cambricon Extension for PyTorch (torch_mlu). Here''s a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:\n\n1. Install the Cambricon CNToolkit by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://www.cambricon.com/docs/sdk_1.15.0/cntoolkit_3.7.2/cntoolkit_install_3.7.2/index.html)\n2. Next, install the PyTorch(torch_mlu) following the instructions on the [Installation](https://www.cambricon.com/docs/sdk_1.15.0/cambricon_pytorch_1.17.0/user_guide_1.9/index.html)\n3. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`\n\n#### Iluvatar Corex\n\nFor models compatible with Iluvatar Extension for PyTorch. Here''s a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:\n\n1. Install the Iluvatar Corex Toolkit by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://support.iluvatar.com/#/DocumentCentre?id=1&nameCenter=2&productId=520117912052801536)\n2. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`\n\n\n## [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager/tree/manager-v4)\n\n**ComfyUI-Manager** is an extension that allows you to easily install, update, and manage custom nodes for ComfyUI.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Install the manager dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r manager_requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n2. Enable the manager with the `--enable-manager` flag when running ComfyUI:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py --enable-manager\n   ```\n\n### Command Line Options\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--enable-manager` | Enable ComfyUI-Manager |\n| `--enable-manager-legacy-ui` | Use the legacy manager UI instead of the new UI (requires `--enable-manager`) |\n| `--disable-manager-ui` | Disable the manager UI and endpoints while keeping background features like security checks and scheduled installation completion (requires `--enable-manager`) |\n\n\n# Running\n\n```python main.py```\n\n### For AMD cards not officially supported by ROCm\n\nTry running it with this command if you have issues:\n\nFor 6700, 6600 and maybe other RDNA2 or older: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 python main.py```\n\nFor AMD 7600 and maybe other RDNA3 cards: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 python main.py```\n\n### AMD ROCm Tips\n\nYou can enable experimental memory efficient attention on recent pytorch in ComfyUI on some AMD GPUs using this command, it should already be enabled by default on RDNA3. If this improves speed for you on latest pytorch on your GPU please report it so that I can enable it by default.\n\n```TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 python main.py --use-pytorch-cross-attention```\n\nYou can also try setting this env variable `PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_ENABLED=1` which might speed things up at the cost of a very slow initial run.\n\n# Notes\n\nOnly parts of the graph that have an output with all the correct inputs will be executed.\n\nOnly parts of the graph that change from each execution to the next will be executed, if you submit the same graph twice only the first will be executed. If you change the last part of the graph only the part you changed and the part that depends on it will be executed.\n\nDragging a generated png on the webpage or loading one will give you the full workflow including seeds that were used to create it.\n\nYou can use () to change emphasis of a word or phrase like: (good code:1.2) or (bad code:0.8). The default emphasis for () is 1.1. To use () characters in your actual prompt escape them like \\( or \\).\n\nYou can use {day|night}, for wildcard/dynamic prompts. With this syntax "{wild|card|test}" will be randomly replaced by either "wild", "card" or "test" by the frontend every time you queue the prompt. To use {} characters in your actual prompt escape them like: \\{ or \\}.\n\nDynamic prompts also support C-style comments, like `// comment` or `/* comment */`.\n\nTo use a textual inversion concepts/embeddings in a text prompt put them in the models/embeddings directory and use them in the CLIPTextEncode node like this (you can omit the .pt extension):\n\n```embedding:embedding_filename.pt```\n\n\n## How to show high-quality previews?\n\nUse ```--preview-method auto``` to enable previews.\n\nThe default installation includes a fast latent preview method that''s low-resolution. To enable higher-quality previews with [TAESD](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd), download the [taesd_decoder.pth, taesdxl_decoder.pth, taesd3_decoder.pth and taef1_decoder.pth](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd/) and place them in the `models/vae_approx` folder. Once they''re installed, restart ComfyUI and launch it with `--preview-method taesd` to enable high-quality previews.\n\n## How to use TLS/SSL?\nGenerate a self-signed certificate (not appropriate for shared/production use) and key by running the command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/C=XX/ST=StateName/L=CityName/O=CompanyName/OU=CompanySectionName/CN=CommonNameOrHostname"`\n\nUse `--tls-keyfile key.pem --tls-certfile cert.pem` to enable TLS/SSL, the app will now be accessible with `https://...` instead of `http://...`.\n\n> Note: Windows users can use [alexisrolland/docker-openssl](https://github.com/alexisrolland/docker-openssl) or one of the [3rd party binary distributions](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries) to run the command example above.\n<br/><br/>If you use a container, note that the volume mount `-v` can be a relative path so `... -v ".\:/openssl-certs" ...` would create the key & cert files in the current directory of your command prompt or powershell terminal.\n\n## Support and dev channel\n\n[Discord](https://comfy.org/discord): Try the #help or #feedback channels.\n\n[Matrix space: #comfyui_space:matrix.org](https://app.element.io/#/room/%23comfyui_space%3Amatrix.org) (it''s like discord but open source).\n\nSee also: [https://www.comfy.org/](https://www.comfy.org/)\n\n## Frontend Development\n\nAs of August 15, 2024, we have transitioned to a new frontend, which is now hosted in a separate repository: [ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend). This repository now hosts the compiled JS (from TS/Vue) under the `web/` directory.\n\n### Reporting Issues and Requesting Features\n\nFor any bugs, issues, or feature requests related to the frontend, please use the [ComfyUI Frontend repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend). This will help us manage and address frontend-specific concerns more efficiently.\n\n### Using the Latest Frontend\n\nThe new frontend is now the default for ComfyUI. However, please note:\n\n1. The frontend in the main ComfyUI repository is updated fortnightly.\n2. Daily releases are available in the separate frontend repository.\n\nTo use the most up-to-date frontend version:\n\n1. For the latest daily release, launch ComfyUI with this command line argument:\n\n   ```\n   --front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@latest\n   ```\n\n2. For a specific version, replace `latest` with the desired version number:\n\n   ```\n   --front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@1.2.2\n   ```\n\nThis approach allows you to easily switch between the stable fortnightly release and the cutting-edge daily updates, or even specific versions for testing purposes.\n\n### Accessing the Legacy Frontend\n\nIf you need to use the legacy frontend for any reason, you can access it using the following command line argument:\n\n```\n--front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend@latest\n```\n\nThis will use a snapshot of the legacy frontend preserved in the [ComfyUI Legacy Frontend repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend).\n\n# QA\n\n### Which GPU should I buy for this?\n\n[See this page for some recommendations](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/wiki/Which-GPU-should-I-buy-for-ComfyUI)\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":96114,"forks":10872,"watchers":96114,"open_issues":3276,"topics":["ai","comfy","comfyui","python","pytorch","stable-diffusion"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":76756,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:badges:shields","source_url":"https://github.com/badges/shields"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:user-attachments:assets","source_url":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:desktop","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI_frontend","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI-Manager","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:madebyollin:taesd","source_url":"https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:madebyollin:taesd","source_url":"https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:alexisrolland:docker-openssl","source_url":"https://github.com/alexisrolland/docker-openssl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI_frontend","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI_frontend","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI_legacy_frontend","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"}]', NULL, 'GPL-3.0', 'approved', 80, 'ccecae2cc0f34fc681358c248a32b7a8', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Best for: sharing your applications and hanging out with the community.\n\n## How it works\n\nSupabase is a combination of open source tools. We’re building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. If the tools and communities exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open license, we will use and support that tool. If the tool doesn''t exist, we build and open source it ourselves. Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. Our aim is to give developers a Firebase-like developer experience using open source tools.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nSupabase is a [hosted platform](https://supabase.com/dashboard). You can sign up and start using Supabase without installing anything.\nYou can also [self-host](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/overview) and [develop locally](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development).\n\n![Architecture](apps/docs/public/img/supabase-architecture.svg)\n\n- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.\n- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) is an Elixir server that allows you to listen to PostgreSQL inserts, updates, and deletes using websockets. Realtime polls Postgres'' built-in replication functionality for database changes, converts changes to JSON, then broadcasts the JSON over websockets to authorized clients.\n- [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/) is a web server that turns your PostgreSQL database directly into a RESTful API.\n- [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue) is a JWT-based authentication API that simplifies user sign-ups, logins, and session management in your applications.\n- [Storage](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api) a RESTful API for managing files in S3, with Postgres handling permissions.\n- [pg_graphql](http://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql/) a PostgreSQL extension that exposes a GraphQL API.\n- [postgres-meta](https://github.com/supabase/postgres-meta) is a RESTful API for managing your Postgres, allowing you to fetch tables, add roles, and run queries, etc.\n- [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong) is a cloud-native API gateway.\n\n#### Client libraries\n\nOur approach for client libraries is modular. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing tools.\n\n<table style="table-layout:fixed; white-space: nowrap;">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Language</th>\n    <th>Client</th>\n    <th colspan="5">Feature-Clients

Consider downloading the quickstart version.**\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see the process</summary>\n\n### Installation\n\nThis is more likely to work on your computer but will be slower as it utilizes the CPU.\n\n**1. Set up Your Platform**\n\n-   Python (3.11 recommended)\n-   pip\n-   git\n-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) - ```iex (irm ffmpeg.tc.ht)```\n-   [Visual Studio 2022 Runtimes (Windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)\n\n**2. Clone the Repository**\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git\ncd Deep-Live-Cam\n```\n\n**3. Download the Models**\n\n1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)\n2. [inswapper\_128\_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx)\n\nPlace these files in the "**models**" folder.\n\n**4. Install Dependencies**\n\nWe highly recommend using a `venv` to avoid issues.\n\n\nFor Windows:\n```bash\npython -m venv venv\nvenv\Scripts\activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nFor Linux:\n```bash\n# Ensure you use the installed Python 3.10\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**For macOS:**\n\nApple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) requires specific setup:\n\n```bash\n# Install Python 3.11 (specific version is important)\nbrew install python@3.11\n\n# Install tkinter package (required for the GUI)\nbrew install python-tk@3.10\n\n# Create and activate virtual environment with Python 3.11\npython3.11 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n** In case something goes wrong and you need to reinstall the virtual environment **\n\n```bash\n# Deactivate the virtual environment\nrm -rf venv\n\n# Reinstall the virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# install the dependencies again\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# gfpgan and basicsrs issue fix\npip install git+https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR.git@master\npip uninstall gfpgan -y\npip install git+https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN.git@master\n```\n\n**Run:** If you don''t have a GPU, you can run Deep-Live-Cam using `python run.py`. Note that initial execution will download models (~300MB).\n\n### GPU Acceleration\n\n**CUDA Execution Provider (Nvidia)**\n\n1. Install [CUDA Toolkit 12.8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-8-0-download-archive)\n2.

Developers use us to reliably convert URLs into LLM-ready markdown or structured data with a single API call.",\n    "supports_sso": false,\n    "is_open_source": true,\n    "is_in_yc": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### LLM Extraction (Beta)\n\nUsed to extract structured data from scraped pages.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \\n  -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n  -H ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'' \\n  -d ''{\n    "url": "https://www.mendable.ai/",\n    "formats": [\n      {\n        "type": "json",\n        "schema": {\n          "type": "object",\n          "properties": {\n            "company_mission": { "type": "string" },\n            "supports_sso": { "type": "boolean" },\n            "is_open_source": { "type": "boolean" },\n            "is_in_yc": { "type": "boolean" }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }''\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  "success": true,\n  "data": {\n    "content": "Raw Content",\n    "metadata": {\n      "title": "Mendable",\n      "description": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",\n      "robots": "follow, index",\n      "ogTitle": "Mendable",\n      "ogDescription": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want.

The llm chooses the structure of the data.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \\n    -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n    -H ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'' \\n    -d ''{\n      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",\n      "formats": [\n        {\n          "type": "json",\n          "prompt": "Extract the company mission from the page."\n        }\n      ]\n    }''\n```\n\n### Interacting with the page with Actions (Cloud-only)\n\nFirecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.\n\nHere is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \\n    -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n    -H ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'' \\n    -d ''{\n        "url": "google.com",\n        "formats": ["markdown"],\n        "actions": [\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},\n            {"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title=\"Search\"]"},\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},\n            {"type": "write", "text": "firecrawl"},\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},\n            {"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},\n            {"type": "click", "selector": "h3"},\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},\n            {"type": "screenshot"}\n        ]\n    }''\n```\n\n### Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)\n\nYou can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/batch/scrape \\n    -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n    -H ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'' \\n    -d ''{\n      "urls": ["https://docs.firecrawl.dev", "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview"],\n      "formats" : ["markdown", "html"]\n    }''\n```\n\n\n\n## Using Python SDK\n\n### Installing Python SDK\n\n```bash\npip install firecrawl-py\n```\n\n### Crawl a website\n\n```python\nfrom firecrawl import Firecrawl\n\nfirecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")\n\n# Scrape a website (returns a Document)\ndoc = firecrawl.scrape(\n    "https://firecrawl.dev",\n    formats=["markdown", "html"],\n)\nprint(doc.markdown)\n\n# Crawl a website\nresponse = firecrawl.crawl(\n    "https://firecrawl.dev",\n    limit=100,\n    scrape_options={"formats": ["markdown", "html"]},\n    poll_interval=30,\n)\nprint(response)\n```\n\n### Extracting structured data from a URL\n\nWith LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Article(BaseModel):\n    title: str\n    points: int\n    by: str\n    commentsURL: str\n\nclass TopArticles(BaseModel):\n    top: List[Article] = Field(..., description="Top 5 stories")\n\n# Use JSON format with a Pydantic schema\ndoc = firecrawl.scrape(\n    "https://news.ycombinator.com",\n    formats=[{"type": "json", "schema": TopArticles}],\n)\nprint(doc.json)\n```\n\n## Using the Node SDK\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @mendable/firecrawl-js\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)\n2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `Firecrawl` class.\n\n```js\nimport Firecrawl from ''@mendable/firecrawl-js'';\n\nconst firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: ''fc-YOUR_API_KEY'' });\n\n// Scrape a website\nconst doc = await firecrawl.scrape(''https://firecrawl.dev'', {\n  formats: [''markdown'', ''html''],\n});\nconsole.log(doc);\n\n// Crawl a website\nconst response = await firecrawl.crawl(''https://firecrawl.dev'', {\n  limit: 100,\n  scrapeOptions: { formats: [''markdown'', ''html''] },\n});\nconsole.log(response);\n```\n\n\n### Extracting structured data from a URL\n\nWith LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how to use it:\n\n```js\nimport Firecrawl from ''@mendable/firecrawl-js'';\nimport { z } from ''zod'';\n\nconst firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: ''fc-YOUR_API_KEY'' });\n\n// Define schema to extract contents into\nconst schema = z.object({\n  top: z\n    .array(\n      z.object({\n        title: z.string(),\n        points: z.number(),\n        by: z.string(),\n        commentsURL: z.string(),\n      })\n    )\n    .length(5)\n    .describe(''Top 5 stories on Hacker News''),\n});\n\n// Use the v2 extract API with direct Zod schema support\nconst extractRes = await firecrawl.extract({\n  urls: [''https://news.ycombinator.com''],\n  schema,\n  prompt: ''Extract the top 5 stories'',\n});\n\nconsole.log(extractRes);\n```\n\n## Open Source vs Cloud Offering\n\nFirecrawl is open source available under the AGPL-3.0 license. \n\nTo deliver the best possible product, we offer a hosted version of Firecrawl alongside our open-source offering.

For example, `qwen3` and `qwen3_nothink`.\n>\n> Remember to use the **SAME** template in training and inference.\n>\n> \*: You should install the `transformers` from main branch and use `DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1` to skip version check.\n>\n> \*\*: You need to install a specific version of `transformers` to use the corresponding model.\n\nPlease refer to

The last version to support Python 3.8 - 3.9 was [0.2.6](https://pypi.org/project/gpt-engineer/0.2.6/).\n\n### Setup API key\n\nChoose **one** of:\n- Export env variable (you can add this to .bashrc so that you don''t have to do it each time you start the terminal)\n    - `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`\n- .env file:\n    - Create a copy of `.env.template` named `.env`\n    - Add your OPENAI_API_KEY in .env\n- Custom model:\n    - See [docs](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html), supports local model, azure, etc.\n\nCheck the [Windows README](./WINDOWS_README.md) for Windows usage.\n\n**Other ways to run:**\n- Use Docker ([instructions](docker/README.md))\n- Do everything in your browser:\n[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/codespaces)\n\n### Create new code (default usage)\n- Create an empty folder for your project anywhere on your computer\n- Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions\n- Run `gpte <project_dir>` with a relative path to your folder\n  - For example: `gpte projects/my-new-project` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your new folder in `projects/`\n\n### Improve existing code\n- Locate a folder with code which you want to improve anywhere on your computer\n- Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions for how you want to improve the code\n- Run `gpte <project_dir> -i` with a relative path to your folder\n  - For example: `gpte projects/my-old-project -i` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your folder in `projects/`\n\n### Benchmark custom agents\n- gpt-engineer installs the binary ''bench'', which gives you a simple interface for benchmarking your own agent implementations against popular public datasets.\n- The easiest way to get started with benchmarking is by checking out the [template](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpte-bench-template) repo, which contains detailed instructions and an agent template.\n- Currently supported benchmark:\n  - [APPS](https://github.com/hendrycks/apps)\n  - [MBPP](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp)\n\nThe community has started work with different benchmarking initiatives, as described in [this Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/206805143fbb4302b5455a5329eaab17?sid=f689608f-8e49-44f7-b55f-4c81e9dc93e6) video.\n\n### Research\nSome of our community members have worked on different research briefs that could be taken further. See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmOj2DvdPc6syIAm8iISZFpfik26BYw7ZziD5c-9G0E/edit?usp=sharing) if you are interested.\n\n## Terms\nBy running gpt-engineer, you agree to our [terms](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/TERMS_OF_USE.md).\n\n\n## Relation to gptengineer.app (GPT Engineer)\n[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app/) is a commercial project for the automatic generation of web apps.\nIt features a UI for non-technical users connected to a git-controlled codebase.\nThe gptengineer.app team is actively supporting the open source community.\n\n\n## Features\n\n### Pre Prompts\nYou can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by overriding the `preprompts` folder with your own version of the `preprompts`. You can do so via the `--use-custom-preprompts` argument.\n\nEditing the `preprompts` is how you make the agent remember things between projects.\n\n### Vision\n\nBy default, gpt-engineer expects text input via a `prompt` file. It can also accept image inputs for vision-capable models. This can be useful for adding UX or architecture diagrams as additional context for GPT Engineer. You can do this by specifying an image directory with the `—-image_directory` flag and setting a vision-capable model in the second CLI argument.\n\nE.g. `gpte projects/example-vision gpt-4-vision-preview --prompt_file prompt/text --image_directory prompt/images -i`\n\n### Open source, local and alternative models\n\nBy default, gpt-engineer supports OpenAI Models via the OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI API, as well as Anthropic models.\n\nWith a little extra setup, you can also run with open source models like WizardCoder. See the [documentation](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html) for example instructions.\n\n## Mission\n\nThe gpt-engineer community mission is to **maintain tools that coding agent builders can use and facilitate collaboration in the open source community**.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this, we are interested in having you.\n\nIf you want to see our broader ambitions, check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/ROADMAP.md), and join\n[discord](https://discord.gg/8tcDQ89Ej2)\nto learn how you can [contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to it.\n\ngpt-engineer is [governed](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) by a board of long-term contributors. If you contribute routinely and have an interest in shaping the future of gpt-engineer, you will be considered for the board.\n\n## Significant contributors\n<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;"> <li style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="https://github.com/ATheorell"> <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143704446?s=64&v=4" alt="@ATheorell" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius: 50%;"> @ATheorell </a> </li> <li style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="https://github.com/similato87"> <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71301573?s=64&v=4" alt="@similato87" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius: 50%;"> @similato87 </a> </li> <li style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="https://github.com/TheoMcCabe"> <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9841960?s=64&v=4" alt="@TheoMcCabe" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius: 50%;"> @TheoMcCabe </a> </li> <li style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="https://github.com/captivus"> <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366332?s=64&v=4" alt="@captivus" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius: 50%;"> @captivus </a> </li> </ul>\n\n\n## Example\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/assets/4467025/40d0a9a8-82d0-4432-9376-136df0d57c99\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":55096,"forks":7347,"watchers":55096,"open_issues":66,"topics":["ai","autonomous-agent","code-generation","codebase-generation","codegen","coding-assistant","gpt-4","gpt-engineer","openai","python"],"default_branch":"main","size_kb":20474,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer.git`","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer.git`"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:codespaces:badge.svg","source_url":"https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpte-bench-template","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpte-bench-template"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:hendrycks:apps","source_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks/apps"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:google-research","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 65, '0b7d284a74123b67f4b8c0b4f75df4b6', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: **specifications become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.\n\n## ⚡ Get Started\n\n### 1. Install Specify CLI\n\nChoose your preferred installation method:\n\n#### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)\n\nInstall once and use everywhere:\n\n```bash\nuv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git\n```\n\nThen use the tool directly:\n\n```bash\n# Create new project\nspecify init <PROJECT_NAME>\n\n# Or initialize in existing project\nspecify init . --ai claude\n# or\nspecify init --here --ai claude\n\n# Check installed tools\nspecify check\n```\n\nTo upgrade Specify, see the [Upgrade Guide](./docs/upgrade.md) for detailed instructions. Quick upgrade:\n\n```bash\nuv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git\n```\n\n#### Option 2: One-time Usage\n\nRun directly without installing:\n\n```bash\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>\n```\n\n**Benefits of persistent installation:**\n\n- Tool stays installed and available in PATH\n- No need to create shell aliases\n- Better tool management with `uv tool list`, `uv tool upgrade`, `uv tool uninstall`\n- Cleaner shell configuration\n\n### 2. Establish project principles\n\nLaunch your AI assistant in the project directory. The `/speckit.*` commands are available in the assistant.\n\nUse the **`/speckit.constitution`** command to create your project''s governing principles and development guidelines that will guide all subsequent development.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements\n```\n\n### 3. Create the spec\n\nUse the **`/speckit.specify`** command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the tech stack.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.\n```\n\n### 4. Create a technical implementation plan\n\nUse the **`/speckit.plan`** command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.\n```\n\n### 5. Break down into tasks\n\nUse **`/speckit.tasks`** to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.tasks\n```\n\n### 6. Execute implementation\n\nUse **`/speckit.implement`** to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.implement\n```\n\nFor detailed step-by-step instructions, see our [comprehensive guide](./spec-driven.md).\n\n## 📽️ Video Overview\n\nWant to see Spec Kit in action?

Run:\n\n```bash\nspecify init <project_name>\n```\n\nOr initialize in the current directory:\n\n```bash\nspecify init .\n# or use the --here flag\nspecify init --here\n# Skip confirmation when the directory already has files\nspecify init . --force\n# or\nspecify init --here --force\n```\n\n![Specify CLI bootstrapping a new project in the terminal](./media/specify_cli.gif)\n\nYou will be prompted to select the AI agent you are using. You can also proactively specify it directly in the terminal:\n\n```bash\nspecify init <project_name> --ai claude\nspecify init <project_name> --ai gemini\nspecify init <project_name> --ai copilot\n\n# Or in current directory:\nspecify init . --ai claude\nspecify init . --ai codex\n\n# or use --here flag\nspecify init --here --ai claude\nspecify init --here --ai codex\n\n# Force merge into a non-empty current directory\nspecify init . --force --ai claude\n\n# or\nspecify init --here --force --ai claude\n```\n\nThe CLI will check if you have Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, Qwen CLI, opencode, Codex CLI, Qoder CLI, or Amazon Q Developer CLI installed. If you do not, or you prefer to get the templates without checking for the right tools, use `--ignore-agent-tools` with your command:\n\n```bash\nspecify init <project_name> --ai claude --ignore-agent-tools\n```\n\n### **STEP 1:** Establish project principles\n\nGo to the project folder and run your AI agent. In our example, we''re using `claude`.\n\n![Bootstrapping Claude Code environment](./media/bootstrap-claude-code.gif)\n\nYou will know that things are configured correctly if you see the `/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, and `/speckit.implement` commands available.\n\nThe first step should be establishing your project''s governing principles using the `/speckit.constitution` command. This helps ensure consistent decision-making throughout all subsequent development phases:\n\n```text\n/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements. Include governance for how these principles should guide technical decisions and implementation choices.\n```\n\nThis step creates or updates the `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file with your project''s foundational guidelines that the AI agent will reference during specification, planning, and implementation phases.\n\n### **STEP 2:** Create project specifications\n\nWith your project principles established, you can now create the functional specifications. Use the `/speckit.specify` command and then provide the concrete requirements for the project you want to develop.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Be as explicit as possible about *what* you are trying to build and *why*. **Do not focus on the tech stack at this point**.\n\nAn example prompt:\n\n```text\nDevelop Taskify, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members,\nassign tasks, comment and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature,\nlet''s call it "Create Taskify," let''s have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined.\nI want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let''s create three\ndifferent sample projects. Let''s have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as "To Do,"\n"In Progress," "In Review," and "Done." There will be no login for this application as this is just the very\nfirst testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card,\nyou should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board.\nYou should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task\ncard, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it''s going to give you a list of the five users to pick\nfrom. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of\nprojects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You''re going to see the columns.\nYou''ll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are\nassigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly\nsee yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can''t edit comments that other people made. You can\ndelete any comments that you made, but you can''t delete comments anybody else made.\n```\n\nAfter this prompt is entered, you should see Claude Code kick off the planning and spec drafting process. Claude Code will also trigger some of the built-in scripts to set up the repository.\n\nOnce this step is completed, you should have a new branch created (e.g., `001-create-taskify`), as well as a new specification in the `specs/001-create-taskify` directory.\n\nThe produced specification should contain a set of user stories and functional requirements, as defined in the template.\n\nAt this stage, your project folder contents should resemble the following:\n\n```text\n└── .specify\n    ├── memory\n    │  └── constitution.md\n    ├── scripts\n    │  ├── check-prerequisites.sh\n    │  ├── common.sh\n    │  ├── create-new-feature.sh\n    │  ├── setup-plan.sh\n    │  └── update-claude-md.sh\n    ├── specs\n    │  └── 001-create-taskify\n    │      └── spec.md\n    └── templates\n        ├── plan-template.md\n        ├── spec-template.md\n        └── tasks-template.md\n```\n\n### **STEP 3:** Functional specification clarification (required before planning)\n\nWith the baseline specification created, you can go ahead and clarify any of the requirements that were not captured properly within the first shot attempt.\n\nYou should run the structured clarification workflow **before** creating a technical plan to reduce rework downstream.\n\nPreferred order:\n\n1. Use `/speckit.clarify` (structured) – sequential, coverage-based questioning that records answers in a Clarifications section.\n2. Optionally follow up with ad-hoc free-form refinement if something still feels vague.\n\nIf you intentionally want to skip clarification (e.g., spike or exploratory prototype), explicitly state that so the agent doesn''t block on missing clarifications.\n\nExample free-form refinement prompt (after `/speckit.clarify` if still needed):\n\n```text\nFor each sample project or project that you create there should be a variable number of tasks between 5 and 15\ntasks for each one randomly distributed into different states of completion. Make sure that there''s at least\none task in each stage of completion.\n```\n\nYou should also ask Claude Code to validate the **Review & Acceptance Checklist**, checking off the things that are validated/pass the requirements, and leave the ones that are not unchecked. The following prompt can be used:\n\n```text\nRead the review and acceptance checklist, and check off each item in the checklist if the feature spec meets the criteria. Leave it empty if it does not.\n```\n\nIt''s important to use the interaction with Claude Code as an opportunity to clarify and ask questions around the specification - **do not treat its first attempt as final**.\n\n### **STEP 4:** Generate a plan\n\nYou can now be specific about the tech stack and other technical requirements. You can use the `/speckit.plan` command that is built into the project template with a prompt like this:\n\n```text\nWe are going to generate this using .NET Aspire, using Postgres as the database. The frontend should use\nBlazor server with drag-and-drop task boards, real-time updates. There should be a REST API created with a projects API,\ntasks API, and a notifications API.\n```\n\nThe output of this step will include a number of implementation detail documents, with your directory tree resembling this:\n\n```text\n.\n├── CLAUDE.md\n├── memory\n│  └── constitution.md\n├── scripts\n│  ├── check-prerequisites.sh\n│  ├── common.sh\n│  ├── create-new-feature.sh\n│  ├── setup-plan.sh\n│  └── update-claude-md.sh\n├── specs\n│  └── 001-create-taskify\n│      ├── contracts\n│      │  ├── api-spec.json\n│      │  └── signalr-spec.md\n│      ├── data-model.md\n│      ├── plan.md\n│      ├── quickstart.md\n│      ├── research.md\n│      └── spec.md\n└── templates\n    ├── CLAUDE-template.md\n    ├── plan-template.md\n    ├── spec-template.md\n    └── tasks-template.md\n```\n\nCheck the `research.md` document to ensure that the right tech stack is used, based on your instructions. You can ask Claude Code to refine it if any of the components stand out, or even have it check the locally-installed version of the platform/framework you want to use (e.g., .NET).\n\nAdditionally, you might want to ask Claude Code to research details about the chosen tech stack if it''s something that is rapidly changing (e.g., .NET Aspire, JS frameworks), with a prompt like this:\n\n```text\nI want you to go through the implementation plan and implementation details, looking for areas that could\nbenefit from additional research as .NET Aspire is a rapidly changing library. For those areas that you identify that\nrequire further research, I want you to update the research document with additional details about the specific\nversions that we are going to be using in this Taskify application and spawn parallel research tasks to clarify\nany details using research from the web.\n```\n\nDuring this process, you might find that Claude Code gets stuck researching the wrong thing - you can help nudge it in the right direction with a prompt like this:\n\n```text\nI think we need to break this down into a series of steps. First, identify a list of tasks\nthat you would need to do during implementation that you''re not sure of or would benefit\nfrom further research. Write down a list of those tasks. And then for each one of these tasks,\nI want you to spin up a separate research task so that the net results is we are researching\nall of those very specific tasks in parallel. What I saw you doing was it looks like you were\nresearching .NET Aspire in general and I don''t think that''s gonna do much for us in this case.\nThat''s way too untargeted research. The research needs to help you solve a specific targeted question.\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Claude Code might be over-eager and add components that you did not ask for. Ask it to clarify the rationale and the source of the change.\n\n### **STEP 5:** Have Claude Code validate the plan\n\nWith the plan in place, you should have Claude Code run through it to make sure that there are no missing pieces. You can use a prompt like this:\n\n```text\nNow I want you to go and audit the implementation plan and the implementation detail files.\nRead through it with an eye on determining whether or not there is a sequence of tasks that you need\nto be doing that are obvious from reading this. Because I don''t know if there''s enough here. For example,\nwhen I look at the core implementation, it would be useful to reference the appropriate places in the implementation\ndetails where it can find the information as it walks through each step in the core implementation or in the refinement.\n```\n\nThis helps refine the implementation plan and helps you avoid potential blind spots that Claude Code missed in its planning cycle. Once the initial refinement pass is complete, ask Claude Code to go through the checklist once more before you can get to the implementation.\n\nYou can also ask Claude Code (if you have the [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli) installed) to go ahead and create a pull request from your current branch to `main` with a detailed description, to make sure that the effort is properly tracked.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Before you have the agent implement it, it''s also worth prompting Claude Code to cross-check the details to see if there are any over-engineered pieces (remember - it can be over-eager). If over-engineered components or decisions exist, you can ask Claude Code to resolve them. Ensure that Claude Code follows the [constitution](base/memory/constitution.md) as the foundational piece that it must adhere to when establishing the plan.\n\n### **STEP 6:** Generate task breakdown with /speckit.tasks\n\nWith the implementation plan validated, you can now break down the plan into specific, actionable tasks that can be executed in the correct order. Use the `/speckit.tasks` command to automatically generate a detailed task breakdown from your implementation plan:\n\n```text\n/speckit.tasks\n```\n\nThis step creates a `tasks.md` file in your feature specification directory that contains:\n\n- **Task breakdown organized by user story** - Each user story becomes a separate implementation phase with its own set of tasks\n- **Dependency management** - Tasks are ordered to respect dependencies between components (e.g., models before services, services before endpoints)\n- **Parallel execution markers** - Tasks that can run in parallel are marked with `[P]` to optimize development workflow\n- **File path specifications** - Each task includes the exact file paths where implementation should occur\n- **Test-driven development structure** - If tests are requested, test tasks are included and ordered to be written before implementation\n- **Checkpoint validation** - Each user story phase includes checkpoints to validate independent functionality\n\nThe generated tasks.md provides a clear roadmap for the `/speckit.implement` command, ensuring systematic implementation that maintains code quality and allows for incremental delivery of user stories.\n\n### **STEP 7:** Implementation\n\nOnce ready, use the `/speckit.implement` command to execute your implementation plan:\n\n```text\n/speckit.implement\n```\n\nThe `/speckit.implement` command will:\n\n- Validate that all prerequisites are in place (constitution, spec, plan, and tasks)\n- Parse the task breakdown from `tasks.md`\n- Execute tasks in the correct order, respecting dependencies and parallel execution markers\n- Follow the TDD approach defined in your task plan\n- Provide progress updates and handle errors appropriately\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The AI agent will execute local CLI commands (such as `dotnet`, `npm`, etc.) - make sure you have the required tools installed on your machine.\n\nOnce the implementation is complete, test the application and resolve any runtime errors that may not be visible in CLI logs (e.g., browser console errors). You can copy and paste such errors back to your AI agent for resolution.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Troubleshooting\n\n### Git Credential Manager on Linux\n\nIf you''re having issues with Git authentication on Linux, you can install Git Credential Manager:\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\necho "Downloading Git Credential Manager v2.6.1..."\nwget https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/releases/download/v2.6.1/gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb\necho "Installing Git Credential Manager..."\nsudo dpkg -i gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb\necho "Configuring Git to use GCM..."\ngit config --global credential.helper manager\necho "Cleaning up..."\nrm gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb\n```\n\n## 👥 Maintainers\n\n- Den Delimarsky ([@localden](https://github.com/localden))\n- John Lam ([@jflam](https://github.com/jflam))\n\n## 💬 Support\n\nFor support, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/new).

Layers have clearly divided responsibilities and build on top of layers below. This design enables you to use the framework at different levels of abstraction, from high-level APIs to low-level components.\n\n- [Core API](./python/packages/autogen-core/) implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime for flexibility and power. It also support cross-language support for .NET and Python.\n- [AgentChat API](./python/packages/autogen-agentchat/) implements a simpler but opinionated API for rapid prototyping. This API is built on top of the Core API and is closest to what users of v0.2 are familiar with and supports common multi-agent patterns such as two-agent chat or group chats.\n- [Extensions API](./python/packages/autogen-ext/) enables first- and third-party extensions continuously expanding framework capabilities. It support specific implementation of LLM clients (e.g., OpenAI, AzureOpenAI), and capabilities such as code execution.\n\nThe ecosystem also supports two essential _developer tools_:\n\n<div align="center">\n  <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/microsoft/autogen/refs/heads/main/python/packages/autogen-studio/docs/ags_screen.png" alt="AutoGen Studio Screenshot" width="500">\n</div>\n\n- [AutoGen Studio](./python/packages/autogen-studio/) provides a no-code GUI for building multi-agent applications.\n- [AutoGen Bench](./python/packages/agbench/) provides a benchmarking suite for evaluating agent performance.\n\nYou can use the AutoGen framework and developer tools to create applications for your domain. For example, [Magentic-One](./python/packages/magentic-one-cli/) is a state-of-the-art multi-agent team built using AgentChat API and Extensions API that can handle a variety of tasks that require web browsing, code execution, and file handling.\n\nWith AutoGen you get to join and contribute to a thriving ecosystem. We host weekly office hours and talks with maintainers and community. We also have a [Discord server](https://aka.ms/autogen-discord) for real-time chat, GitHub Discussions for Q&A, and a blog for tutorials and updates.\n\n## Where to go next?\n\n<div

However, it also uses a set of native OS-specific components for desktop UI, high performance database drivers and networking.\n- Basic frameworks:\n  - [OSGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) platform for plugins and dependency management. Community version consists of 130+ plugins.\n  - [Eclipse RCP](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.ui/blob/master/docs/Rich_Client_Platform.md) platform for rich user interface build.\n  - [JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity) for basic database connectivity API.\n  - [JSQLParser](https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser) and [Antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) for SQL grammar and semantic parser.\n- For networking and additional functionality we use wide range of open source libraries such as [SSHJ](https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj), [Apache POI](https://github.com/apache/poi), [JFreeChart](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart), [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts), [Apache JEXL](https://github.com/apache/commons-jexl) etc.\n- We separate model plugins from desktop UI plugins. This allows us to use the same set of "back-end" plugins in both DBeaver and [CloudBeaver](https://github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver).\n- Dependencies: being an OSGI application we use P2 repositories for third party dependencies. For additional Maven dependencies we use our own [DBeaver P2 repo](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver-deps-ce).\n\n## Supported databases\n\n### Community version\n\nOut of the box DBeaver supports following database drivers: \nMySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, DB2, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Sybase, Apache Hive, Drill, Presto, Trino, Phoenix, Exasol, Informix, Teradata, Vertica, Netezza, Firebird, Derby, H2, H2GIS, WMI, Snowflake, Greenplum, Redshift, Athena, SAP HANA, MaxDB, NuoDB, MS Access, SQLite, CSV, DBF, Firebird, TimescaleDB, Yellowbrick, CockroachDB, OrientDB, MonetDB, Google BigQuery, Google Spanner, Apache Hive/Impala/Spark, Apache Ignite, MapD, Azure SQL, CrateDB, Elasticsearch, Ocient, Ingres, OmniSci, Yugabyte, IRIS, Data Virtuality, Denodo, Virtuoso, Machbase, DuckDB, Babelfish, OceanBase, Salesforce, EnterpriseDB, Apache Druid, Apache Kylin, Databricks, OpenSearch, TiDB, TDEngine, Materialize, JDBCX, Dameng, Altibase, StarRocks, CUBRID, GaussDB, DolphinDB, LibSQL, GBase 8s, Databend, Cloudberry, Teiid, Kingbase.\n\n### PRO versions\n\n<a href="https://dbeaver.com/download/">Commercial versions</a> extends functionality of many popular drivers and also support non-JDBC datasources such as:\nODBC, MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, CouchDB, Redis, InfluxDB, Firestore, BigTable, DynamoDB, Kafka KSQL, Neo4j, AWS Neptune, AWS Timestream, Azure CosmosDB, Yugabyte, Salesforce, etc.  \nAlso, we support flat files as databases: CSV, XLSX, Json, XML, Parquet.  \nYou can find the list of all databases supported in commercial versions <a href="https://dbeaver.com/databases/">here</a>.\n\n## Feedback\n\n- For bug reports and feature requests - please <a href="https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues">create a ticket</a>.\n- To promote <a href="https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3A%22wait+for+votes%22">a ticket</a> to a higher priority - please vote for it with 👍 under the ticket description.\n- If you have any questions, ideas, etc - please <a href="https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/discussions">start a discussion</a>.\n- Pull requests are welcome.

Sign up on [Mem0 Platform](https://app.mem0.ai)\n2. Embed the memory layer via SDK or API keys\n\n### Self-Hosted (Open Source)\n\nInstall the sdk via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install mem0ai\n```\n\nInstall sdk via npm:\n```bash\nnpm install mem0ai\n```\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nMem0 requires an LLM to function, with `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14 from OpenAI as the default. However, it supports a variety of LLMs; for details, refer to our [Supported LLMs documentation](https://docs.mem0.ai/components/llms/overview).\n\nFirst step is to instantiate the memory:\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom mem0 import Memory\n\nopenai_client = OpenAI()\nmemory = Memory()\n\ndef chat_with_memories(message: str, user_id: str = "default_user") -> str:\n    # Retrieve relevant memories\n    relevant_memories = memory.search(query=message, user_id=user_id, limit=3)\n    memories_str = "\n".join(f"- {entry[''memory'']}" for entry in relevant_memories["results"])\n\n    # Generate Assistant response\n    system_prompt = f"You are a helpful AI. Answer the question based on query and memories.\nUser Memories:\n{memories_str}"\n    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}, {"role": "user", "content": message}]\n    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", messages=messages)\n    assistant_response = response.choices[0].message.content\n\n    # Create new memories from the conversation\n    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_response})\n    memory.add(messages, user_id=user_id)\n\n    return assistant_response\n\ndef main():\n    print("Chat with AI (type ''exit'' to quit)")\n    while True:\n        user_input = input("You: ").strip()\n        if user_input.lower() == ''exit'':\n            print("Goodbye!")\n            break\n        print(f"AI: {chat_with_memories(user_input)}")\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    main()\n```\n\nFor detailed integration steps, see the [Quickstart](https://docs.mem0.ai/quickstart) and [API Reference](https://docs.mem0.ai/api-reference).\n\n## 🔗 Integrations & Demos\n\n- **ChatGPT with Memory**: Personalized chat powered by Mem0 ([Live Demo](https://mem0.dev/demo))\n- **Browser Extension**: Store memories across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude ([Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/onihkkbipkfeijkadecaafbgagkhglop?utm_source=item-share-cb))\n- **Langgraph Support**: Build a customer bot with Langgraph + Mem0 ([Guide](https://docs.mem0.ai/integrations/langgraph))\n- **CrewAI Integration**: Tailor CrewAI outputs with Mem0 ([Example](https://docs.mem0.ai/integrations/crewai))\n\n## 📚 Documentation & Support\n\n- Full docs: https://docs.mem0.ai\n- Community: [Discord](https://mem0.dev/DiG) · [Twitter](https://x.com/mem0ai)\n- Contact: founders@mem0.ai\n\n## Citation\n\nWe now have a paper you can cite:\n\n```bibtex\n@article{mem0,\n  title={Mem0: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long-Term Memory},\n  author={Chhikara, Prateek and Khant, Dev and Aryan, Saket and Singh, Taranjeet and Yadav, Deshraj},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.19413},\n  year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n## ⚖️ License\n\nApache 2.0 — see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/blob/main/LICENSE) file for details.', '{"language":"Python","stars":44005,"forks":4772,"watchers":44005,"open_issues":540,"topics":["agents","ai","ai-agents","application","chatbots","chatgpt","genai","hacktoberfest","llm","long-term-memory","memory","memory-management","python","rag","state-management"],"default_branch":"main","size_kb":44076,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:mem0ai:mem0\">","source_url":"https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0\">"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:mem0ai:mem0\">","source_url":"https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0\">"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:mem0ai:mem0","source_url":"https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 65, 'b5461b29178de3d84a3a46caa311c639', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

things work"。\n\n从那时起，我便认为，通过阅读源码，站在前辈的角度上，去思考代码架构与程序逻辑，乃是提升编程技巧最好的方式。\n\n因此，GitHub 也自然而然的，成为我最喜爱的开发者平台。\n\n秉着挖掘开源价值的初衷，GitHubDaily 自 2015 年 10 月 10 日正式成立。\n\n我们希望能通过这一举措，帮助开发者们发现当下最火的开源项目，掌控最新技术动态, 扩大技术视野, 并从开源项目的学习中获得编程能力的提升。\n\n目前，GitHubDaily 已累积分享超过 8000 个开源项目，内容包括但不限于 GitHub 上的开源技术资料、开发者工具、编程网站以及成熟应用。\n\n除了 GitHub 之外，我们也开始在下面多个社交媒体平台，帮助开发者传播与分享优质开源项目，挖掘其未来的技术应用前景。\n\n如果你想接收最新的 GitHub

If not, you can follow the instructions below to get started with Kong on your own infrastructure.\n\nLet’s test drive Kong by adding authentication to an API in under 5 minutes.\n\nWe suggest using the docker-compose distribution via the instructions below, but there is also a [docker installation](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/install/docker/#install-kong-gateway-in-db-less-mode) procedure if you’d prefer to run the Kong Gateway in DB-less mode.\n\nWhether you’re running in the cloud, on bare metal, or using containers, you can find every supported distribution on our [official installation](https://konghq.com/install/#kong-community) page.\n\n1) To start, clone the Docker repository and navigate to the compose folder.\n```cmd\n  $ git clone https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong\n  $ cd docker-kong/compose/\n```\n\n2) Start the Gateway stack using:\n```cmd\n  $ KONG_DATABASE=postgres docker-compose --profile database up\n```\n\nThe Gateway is now available on the following ports on localhost:\n\n- `:8000` - send traffic to your service via Kong\n- `:8001` - configure Kong using Admin API or via [decK](https://github.com/kong/deck)\n- `:8002` - access Kong''s management Web UI ([Kong Manager](https://github.com/Kong/kong-manager)) on [localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)\n\nNext, follow the [quick start guide](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/getting-started/configuring-a-service/\n) to tour the Gateway features.\n\n### Getting started with AI Gateway for LLM and MCP\n\nIf you would like to get started with Kong AI Gateway capabilities including LLM and MCP features, please refer to the [official AI documentation](https://developer.konghq.com/ai-gateway/).\n\n## Features\n\nBy centralizing common API, AI and MCP functionality across all your organization''s services, Kong Gateway creates more freedom for engineering teams to focus on the challenges that matter most.\n\nThe top Kong features include:\n\n- Advanced routing, load balancing, health checking - all configurable via a RESTful admin API or declarative configuration.\n- Authentication and authorization for APIs using methods like JWT, basic auth, OAuth, ACLs and more.\n- Universal LLM API to route across multiple providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, GCP Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, Databricks, Mistral, Huggingface and more.\n- MCP traffic governance, MCP security and MCP observability in addition to MCP autogeneration from any RESTful API.\n- 60+ AI features like AI observability, semantic security and caching, semantic routing and more.\n- Proxy, SSL/TLS termination, and connectivity support for L4 or L7 traffic.\n- Plugins for enforcing traffic controls, rate limiting, req/res transformations, logging, monitoring and including a plugin developer hub.\n- Sophisticated deployment models like Declarative Databaseless Deployment and Hybrid Deployment (control plane/data plane separation) without any vendor lock-in.\n- Native [ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller) support for serving Kubernetes.\n\n[![][kong-benefits]][kong-url]\n\n### Plugin Hub\n\nPlugins provide advanced functionality that extends the use of the Gateway. Many of the Kong Inc. and community-developed plugins like AWS Lambda, Correlation ID, and Response Transformer are showcased at the [Plugin Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/).\n\nContribute to the Plugin Hub and ensure your next innovative idea is published and available to the broader community!\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe ❤️ pull requests, and we’re continually working hard to make it as easy as possible for developers to contribute.

It uses Real-ESRGAN and Vulkan architecture to achieve this. [Our backend](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl-ncnn) is fully open-source under the AGPLv3 license.\n- **I don''t see a drastic change in my upscaled image. Why is that?**\n  - Upscayl can enhance low resolution images and images that are pixelated but it cannot de-blur or do focus adjustment on your image. If your image is out-of-focus or totally blurred, Upscayl is not the right tool for it. Please use images that are similar to the [examples we''ve given here.](COMPARISONS.MD)\n- **Is there a CLI available?**\n  - The CLI tool is called [upscayl-ncnn](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl-ncnn).\n- **Do I need a GPU for this to work?**\n  - Yes, unfortunately. NCNN Vulkan requires a Vulkan-compatible GPU. Upscayl won''t work with **most** iGPUs or CPUs. But hey, no harm in trying ;)\n    - @Wyrdgirn has contributed a workaround for Windows and Linux in [#390](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/issues/390)! Nobody knows how to manipulate the macOS and Haiku frameworks...\n- **I stopped the magic Batch Upscayl and my images haven''t been processed, compressed, or are in the wrong scale!**\n  - When a model doesn''t support an action, Upscayl will finish upscayling all the images first before post-processing them. What this means is that you should simply **wait** for the process to finish.\n- **How can I contribute?**\n  - You can report issues, fix code and add features by submitting PRs, or donate! 😊\n- **What''s the GPU ID for?**\n  - It is for selecting which GPU to use. The specific procedure is detailed in the [Wiki](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/wiki/Guide).\n    - Note that for Windows systems, if Upscayl is not set to performance mode, the system may override this setting.\n- **Where do I find more models?**\n  -  More models can be taken from here: https://github.com/upscayl/custom-models\n\n# 🎁 Donate\n\n<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/fossisthefuture">\n  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25067102/154570688-9e143f2b-fee3-4b05-a9d2-a7a3013b2b51.png" />\n<a/>\n\n# ❤ Credits\n\n- Real-ESRGAN for their wonderful research work.\n[Real-ESRGAN: Copyright (c) 2021, Xintao Wang](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/)\n- @JanDeDinoMan, @xanderfrangos, @Fdawgs, @keturn for their code contributions\n- @aaronliu0130 for providing community support :)\n- Helaman for their [HFA2k model](https://openmodeldb.info/models/4x-HFA2k) (included as "High Fidelity")\n- Foolhardy for their [Remacri model](https://openmodeldb.info/models/4x-Remacri).\n- [Kim2091](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/User:Kim2091)	for their [Ultrasharp and Ultramix Balanced model](https://openmodeldb.info/models/4x-UltraSharp).\n- @NicKoehler for their amazing logo :)\n#\n\n<div align="center">\n\nCopyright © 2023 - **Upscayl**\\nBy Nayam Amarshe and TGS963\\nMade with 🖱 & ⌨\n\n</div>\n', '{"language":"TypeScript","stars":41593,"forks":1966,"watchers":41593,"open_issues":65,"topics":["ai","electron","esrgan","gigapixel","gigapixel-images","image","image-upscaling","topaz","upscale","upscalerimage","upscayl"],"default_branch":"main","size_kb":567613,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:user-attachments:assets","source_url":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:user-attachments:assets","source_url":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:MrPenguin07:ebuilds\">","source_url":"https://github.com/MrPenguin07/ebuilds\">"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:custom-models","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/custom-models"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:orgs:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/orgs/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl-ncnn","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl-ncnn"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl-ncnn","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl-ncnn"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:upscayl","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:upscayl:custom-models","source_url":"https://github.com/upscayl/custom-models"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:xinntao:Real-ESRGAN","source_url":"https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN"}]', NULL, 'AGPL-3.0', 'approved', 80, '5e63c36efe2f00b606c27ca44665fda8', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

agents by following this tutorial.\n\n[![CrewAI Getting Started Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-kSOTtYzgEw/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kSOTtYzgEw "CrewAI Getting Started Tutorial")\n\n###\n Learning Resources\n\nLearn CrewAI through our comprehensive courses:\n\n- [Multi AI Agent Systems with CrewAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/) - Master the fundamentals of multi-agent systems\n- [Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/practical-multi-ai-agents-and-advanced-use-cases-with-crewai/) - Deep dive into advanced implementations\n\n### Understanding Flows and Crews\n\nCrewAI offers two powerful, complementary approaches that work seamlessly together to build sophisticated AI applications:\n\n1. **Crews**: Teams of AI agents with true autonomy and agency, working together to accomplish complex tasks through role-based collaboration. Crews enable:\n\n   - Natural, autonomous decision-making between agents\n   - Dynamic task delegation and collaboration\n   - Specialized roles with defined goals and expertise\n   - Flexible problem-solving approaches\n2. **Flows**: Production-ready, event-driven workflows that deliver precise control over complex automations. Flows provide:\n\n   - Fine-grained control over execution paths for real-world scenarios\n   - Secure, consistent state management between tasks\n   - Clean integration of AI agents with production Python code\n   - Conditional branching for complex business logic\n\nThe true power of CrewAI emerges when combining Crews and Flows. This synergy allows you to:\n\n- Build complex, production-grade applications\n- Balance autonomy with precise control\n- Handle sophisticated real-world scenarios\n- Maintain clean, maintainable code structure\n\n### Getting Started with Installation\n\nTo get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:\n\n### 1. Installation\n\nEnsure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.\n\nFirst, install CrewAI:\n\n```shell\npip install crewai\n```\n\nIf you want to install the ''crewai'' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command:\n\n```shell\npip install ''crewai[tools]''\n```\n\nThe command above installs the basic package and also adds extra components which require more dependencies to function.\n\n### Troubleshooting Dependencies\n\nIf you encounter issues during installation or usage, here are some common solutions:\n\n#### Common Issues\n\n1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ''tiktoken''**\n\n   - Install tiktoken explicitly: `pip install ''crewai[embeddings]''`\n   - If using embedchain or other tools: `pip install ''crewai[tools]''`\n2. **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**\n\n   - Ensure Rust compiler is installed (see installation steps above)\n   - For Windows: Verify Visual C++ Build Tools are installed\n   - Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`\n   - If issues persist, use a pre-built wheel: `pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary`\n\n### 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration\n\nTo create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:\n\n```shell\ncrewai create crew <project_name>\n```\n\nThis command creates a new project folder with the following structure:\n\n```\nmy_project/\n├── .gitignore\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── README.md\n├── .env\n└── src/\n    └── my_project/\n        ├── __init__.py\n        ├── main.py\n        ├── crew.py\n        ├── tools/\n        │   ├── custom_tool.py\n        │   └── __init__.py\n        └── config/\n            ├── agents.yaml\n            └── tasks.yaml\n```\n\nYou can now start developing your crew by editing the files in the `src/my_project` folder. The `main.py` file is the entry point of the project, the `crew.py` file is where you define your crew, the `agents.yaml` file is where you define your agents, and the `tasks.yaml` file is where you define your tasks.\n\n#### To customize your project, you can:\n\n- Modify `src/my_project/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents.\n- Modify `src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks.\n- Modify `src/my_project/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools, and specific arguments.\n- Modify `src/my_project/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks.\n- Add your environment variables into the `.env` file.\n\n#### Example of a simple crew with a sequential process:\n\nInstantiate your crew:\n\n```shell\ncrewai create crew latest-ai-development\n```\n\nModify the files as needed to fit your use case:\n\n**agents.yaml**\n\n```yaml\n# src/my_project/config/agents.yaml\nresearcher:\n  role: >\n    {topic} Senior Data Researcher\n  goal: >\n    Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}\n  backstory: >\n    You''re a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest\n    developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant\n    information and present it in a clear and concise manner.\n\nreporting_analyst:\n  role: >\n    {topic} Reporting Analyst\n  goal: >\n    Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings\n  backstory: >\n    You''re a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail.

This can be used with `@start`, `@listen`, or `@router` decorators to create complex triggering conditions.\n\n- `or_`: Triggers when any of the specified conditions are met.\n- `and_`Triggers when all of the specified conditions are met.\n\nHere''s how you can orchestrate multiple Crews within a Flow:\n\n```python\nfrom crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router, or_\nfrom crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\n# Define structured state for precise control\nclass MarketState(BaseModel):\n    sentiment: str = "neutral"\n    confidence: float = 0.0\n    recommendations: list = []\n\nclass AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):\n    @start()\n    def fetch_market_data(self):\n        # Demonstrate low-level control with structured state\n        self.state.sentiment = "analyzing"\n        return {"sector": "tech", "timeframe": "1W"}  # These parameters match the task description template\n\n    @listen(fetch_market_data)\n    def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):\n        # Show crew agency through specialized roles\n        analyst = Agent(\n            role="Senior Market Analyst",\n            goal="Conduct deep market analysis with expert insight",\n            backstory="You''re a veteran analyst known for identifying subtle market patterns"\n        )\n        researcher = Agent(\n            role="Data Researcher",\n            goal="Gather and validate supporting market data",\n            backstory="You excel at finding and correlating multiple data sources"\n        )\n\n        analysis_task = Task(\n            description="Analyze {sector} sector data for the past {timeframe}",\n            expected_output="Detailed market analysis with confidence score",\n            agent=analyst\n        )\n        research_task = Task(\n            description="Find supporting data to validate the analysis",\n            expected_output="Corroborating evidence and potential contradictions",\n            agent=researcher\n        )\n\n        # Demonstrate crew autonomy\n        analysis_crew = Crew(\n            agents=[analyst, researcher],\n            tasks=[analysis_task, research_task],\n            process=Process.sequential,\n            verbose=True\n        )\n        return analysis_crew.kickoff(inputs=market_data)  # Pass market_data as named inputs\n\n    @router(analyze_with_crew)\n    def determine_next_steps(self):\n        # Show flow control with conditional routing\n        if self.state.confidence > 0.8:\n            return "high_confidence"\n        elif self.state.confidence > 0.5:\n            return "medium_confidence"\n        return "low_confidence"\n\n    @listen("high_confidence")\n    def execute_strategy(self):\n        # Demonstrate complex decision making\n        strategy_crew = Crew(\n            agents=[\n                Agent(role="Strategy Expert",\n                      goal="Develop optimal market strategy")\n            ],\n            tasks=[\n                Task(description="Create detailed strategy based on analysis",\n                     expected_output="Step-by-step action plan")\n            ]\n        )\n        return strategy_crew.kickoff()\n\n    @listen(or_("medium_confidence", "low_confidence"))\n    def request_additional_analysis(self):\n        self.state.recommendations.append("Gather more data")\n        return "Additional analysis required"\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to:\n\n1. Use Python code for basic data operations\n2. Create and execute Crews as steps in your workflow\n3. Use Flow decorators to manage the sequence of operations\n4. Implement conditional branching based on Crew results\n\n## Connecting Your Crew to a Model\n\nCrewAI supports using various LLMs through a variety of connection options. By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.\n\nPlease refer to the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page for details on configuring your agents'' connections to models.\n\n## How CrewAI Compares\n\n**CrewAI''s Advantage**: CrewAI combines autonomous agent intelligence with precise workflow control through its unique Crews and Flows architecture. The framework excels at both high-level orchestration and low-level customization, enabling complex, production-grade systems with granular control.\n\n- **LangGraph**: While LangGraph provides a foundation for building agent workflows, its approach requires significant boilerplate code and complex state management patterns. The framework''s tight coupling with LangChain can limit flexibility when implementing custom agent behaviors or integrating with external systems.\n\n*P.S. CrewAI demonstrates significant performance advantages over LangGraph, executing 5.76x faster in certain cases like this QA task example ([see comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent)) while achieving higher evaluation scores with faster completion times in certain coding tasks, like in this example ([detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb)).*\n\n- **Autogen**: While Autogen excels at creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents'' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.\n- **ChatDev**: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.\n\n## Contribution\n\nCrewAI is open-source and we welcome contributions. If you''re looking to contribute, please:\n\n- Fork the repository.\n- Create a new branch for your feature.\n- Add your feature or improvement.\n- Send a pull request.\n- We appreciate your input!\n\n### Installing Dependencies\n\n```bash\nuv lock\nuv sync\n```\n\n### Virtual Env\n\n```bash\nuv venv\n```\n\n### Pre-commit hooks\n\n```bash\npre-commit install\n```\n\n### Running Tests\n\n```bash\nuv run pytest .\n```\n\n### Running static type checks\n\n```bash\nuvx mypy src\n```\n\n### Packaging\n\n```bash\nuv build\n```\n\n### Installing Locally\n\n```bash\npip install dist/*.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Telemetry\n\nCrewAI uses anonymous telemetry to collect usage data with the main purpose of helping us improve the library by focusing our efforts on the most used features, integrations and tools.\n\nIt''s pivotal to understand that **NO data is collected** concerning prompts, task descriptions, agents'' backstories or goals, usage of tools, API calls, responses, any data processed by the agents, or secrets and environment variables, with the exception of the conditions mentioned. When the `share_crew` feature is enabled, detailed data including task descriptions, agents'' backstories or goals, and other specific attributes are collected to provide deeper insights while respecting user privacy. Users can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable OTEL_SDK_DISABLED to true.\n\nData collected includes:\n\n- Version of CrewAI\n  - So we can understand how many users are using the latest version\n- Version of Python\n  - So we can decide on what versions to better support\n- General OS (e.g. number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux)\n  - So we know what OS we should focus on and if we could build specific OS related features\n- Number of agents and tasks in a crew\n  - So we make sure we are testing internally with similar use cases and educate people on the best practices\n- Crew Process being used\n  - Understand where we should focus our efforts\n- If Agents are using memory or allowing delegation\n  - Understand if we improved the features or maybe even drop them\n- If Tasks are being executed in parallel or sequentially\n  - Understand if we should focus more on parallel execution\n- Language model being used\n  - Improved support on most used languages\n- Roles of agents in a crew\n  - Understand high level use cases so we can build better tools, integrations and examples about it\n- Tools names available\n  - Understand out of the publicly available tools, which ones are being used the most so we can improve them\n\nUsers can opt-in to Further Telemetry, sharing the complete telemetry data by setting the `share_crew` attribute to `True` on their Crews. Enabling `share_crew` results in the collection of detailed crew and task execution data, including `goal`, `backstory`, `context`, and `output` of tasks. This enables a deeper insight into usage patterns while respecting the user''s choice to share.\n\n## License\n\nCrewAI is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### General\n\n- [What exactly is CrewAI?](#q-what-exactly-is-crewai)\n- [How do I install CrewAI?](#q-how-do-i-install-crewai)\n- [Does CrewAI depend on LangChain?](#q-does-crewai-depend-on-langchain)\n- [Is CrewAI open-source?](#q-is-crewai-open-source)\n- [Does CrewAI collect data from users?](#q-does-crewai-collect-data-from-users)\n\n### Features and Capabilities\n\n- [Can CrewAI handle complex use cases?](#q-can-crewai-handle-complex-use-cases)\n- [Can I use CrewAI with local AI models?](#q-can-i-use-crewai-with-local-ai-models)\n- [What makes Crews different from Flows?](#q-what-makes-crews-different-from-flows)\n- [How is CrewAI better than LangChain?](#q-how-is-crewai-better-than-langchain)\n- [Does CrewAI support fine-tuning or training custom models?](#q-does-crewai-support-fine-tuning-or-training-custom-models)\n\n### Resources and Community\n\n- [Where can I find real-world CrewAI examples?](#q-where-can-i-find-real-world-crewai-examples)\n- [How can I contribute to CrewAI?](#q-how-can-i-contribute-to-crewai)\n\n### Enterprise Features\n\n- [What additional features does CrewAI AOP offer?](#q-what-additional-features-does-crewai-amp-offer)\n- [Is CrewAI AOP available for cloud and on-premise deployments?](#q-is-crewai-amp-available-for-cloud-and-on-premise-deployments)\n- [Can I try CrewAI AOP for free?](#q-can-i-try-crewai-amp-for-free)\n\n### Q: What exactly is CrewAI?\n\nA: CrewAI is a standalone, lean, and fast Python framework built specifically for orchestrating autonomous AI agents.

机器人回复的内容会以 "[bot] " 作为前缀， 以区分真人，对应的配置项为 `single_chat_reply_prefix` (如果不需要前缀可以填写 `"single_chat_reply_prefix": ""`)\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2. 群聊配置</summary>\n\n+ 群组聊天中，群名称需配置在 `group_name_white_list ` 中才能开启群聊自动回复。如果想对所有群聊生效，可以直接填写 `"group_name_white_list": ["ALL_GROUP"]`\n+ 默认只要被人 @ 就会触发机器人自动回复；另外群聊天中只要检测到以 "@bot" 开头的内容，同样会自动回复（方便自己触发），这对应配置项 `group_chat_prefix`\n+ 可选配置: `group_name_keyword_white_list`配置项支持模糊匹配群名称，`group_chat_keyword`配置项则支持模糊匹配群消息内容，用法与上述两个配置项相同。（Contributed by [evolay](https://github.com/evolay))\n+ `group_chat_in_one_session`：使群聊共享一个会话上下文，配置 `["ALL_GROUP"]` 则作用于所有群聊\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>3. 语音配置</summary>\n\n+ 添加 `"speech_recognition": true` 将开启语音识别，默认使用openai的whisper模型识别为文字，同时以文字回复，该参数仅支持私聊 (注意由于语音消息无法匹配前缀，一旦开启将对所有语音自动回复，支持语音触发画图)；\n+ 添加 `"group_speech_recognition": true` 将开启群组语音识别，默认使用openai的whisper模型识别为文字，同时以文字回复，参数仅支持群聊 (会匹配group_chat_prefix和group_chat_keyword, 支持语音触发画图)；\n+ 添加 `"voice_reply_voice": true` 将开启语音回复语音（同时作用于私聊和群聊）\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>4. 其他配置</summary>\n\n+ `model`: 模型名称，目前支持 `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `wenxin` , `claude` , `gemini`, `glm-4`,  `xunfei`, `moonshot`等，全部模型名称参考[common/const.py](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/common/const.py)文件\n+ `temperature`,`frequency_penalty`,`presence_penalty`: Chat API接口参数，详情参考[OpenAI官方文档。](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)\n+ `proxy`：由于目前 `openai` 接口国内无法访问，需配置代理客户端的地址，详情参考  [#351](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/issues/351)\n+ 对于图像生成，在满足个人或群组触发条件外，还需要额外的关键词前缀来触发，对应配置 `image_create_prefix `\n+ 关于OpenAI对话及图片接口的参数配置（内容自由度、回复字数限制、图片大小等），可以参考 [对话接口](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) 和 [图像接口](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)  文档，在[`config.py`](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/config.py)中检查哪些参数在本项目中是可配置的。\n+ `conversation_max_tokens`：表示能够记忆的上下文最大字数（一问一答为一组对话，如果累积的对话字数超出限制，就会优先移除最早的一组对话）\n+ `rate_limit_chatgpt`，`rate_limit_dalle`：每分钟最高问答速率、画图速率，超速后排队按序处理。\n+ `clear_memory_commands`: 对话内指令，主动清空前文记忆，字符串数组可自定义指令别名。\n+ `hot_reload`: 程序退出后，暂存等于状态，默认关闭。\n+ `character_desc` 配置中保存着你对机器人说的一段话，他会记住这段话并作为他的设定，你可以为他定制任何人格      (关于会话上下文的更多内容参考该 [issue](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/issues/43))\n+ `subscribe_msg`：订阅消息，公众号和企业微信channel中请填写，当被订阅时会自动回复， 可使用特殊占位符。目前支持的占位符有{trigger_prefix}，在程序中它会自动替换成bot的触发词。\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>5. LinkAI配置</summary>\n\n+ `use_linkai`: 是否使用LinkAI接口，默认关闭，设置为true后可对接LinkAI平台的Agent，使用知识库、工作流、联网搜索、`Midjourney` 绘画等能力, 参考 [文档](https://link-ai.tech/platform/link-app/wechat)\n+ `linkai_api_key`: LinkAI Api Key，可在 [控制台](https://link-ai.tech/console/interface) 创建\n+ `linkai_app_code`: LinkAI 应用或工作流的code，选填\n</details>\n\n注：完整配置项说明可在 [`config.py`](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/config.py) 文件中查看。\n\n## 三、运行\n\n### 1.本地运行\n\n如果是个人计算机 **本地运行**，直接在项目根目录下执行：\n\n```bash\npython3 app.py         # windows环境下该命令通常为 python app.py\n```\n\n运行后默认会启动一个web服务，可以通过访问 `http://localhost:9899/chat` 在网页端对话。如果需要接入其他应用通道只需修改 `config.json` 配置文件中的 `channel_type` 参数，详情参考：[通道说明](#通道说明)。\n\n向机器人发送 `#help` 消息可以查看可用指令及插件的说明。\n\n### 2.服务器部署\n\n在服务器中可使用 `nohup` 命令在后台运行程序：\n\n```bash\nnohup python3 app.py & tail -f nohup.out\n```\n\n执行后程序运行于服务器后台，可通过 `ctrl+c` 关闭日志，不会影响后台程序的运行。使用 `ps -ef | grep app.py | grep -v grep` 命令可查看运行于后台的进程，如果想要重新启动程序可以先 `kill` 掉对应的进程。 日志关闭后如果想要再次打开只需输入 `tail -f nohup.out`。 \n\n此外，项目的 `scripts` 目录下有一键运行、关闭程序的脚本供使用。 运行后默认channel为web，通过可以通过修改配置文件进行切换。\n\n\n### 3.Docker部署\n\n使用docker部署无需下载源码和安装依赖，只需要获取 `docker-compose.yml` 配置文件并启动容器即可。\n\n> 前提是需要安装好 `docker` 及 `docker-compose`，安装成功后执行 `docker -v` 和 `docker-compose version` (或 `docker compose version`) 可查看到版本号。安装地址为 [docker官网](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 。\n\n**(1) 下载 docker-compose.yml 文件**\n\n```bash\nwget https://cdn.link-ai.tech/code/cow/docker-compose.yml\n```\n\n下载完成后打开 `docker-compose.yml` 填写所需配置，例如 `CHANNEL_TYPE`、`OPEN_AI_API_KEY` 和等配置。\n\n**(2) 启动容器**\n\n在 `docker-compose.yml` 所在目录下执行以下命令启动容器：\n\n```bash\nsudo docker compose up -d         # 若docker-compose为 1.X 版本，则执行 `sudo  docker-compose up -d`\n```\n\n运行命令后，会自动取 [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat) 拉取最新release版本的镜像。当执行 `sudo docker ps` 能查看到 NAMES 为 chatgpt-on-wechat 的容器即表示运行成功。最后执行以下命令可查看容器的运行日志：\n\n```bash\nsudo docker logs -f chatgpt-on-wechat\n```\n\n**(3) 插件使用**\n\n如果需要在docker容器中修改插件配置，可通过挂载的方式完成，将 [插件配置文件](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/plugins/config.json.template)\n重命名为 `config.json`，放置于 `docker-compose.yml` 相同目录下，并在 `docker-compose.yml` 中的 `chatgpt-on-wechat` 部分下添加 `volumes` 映射:\n\n```\nvolumes:\n  - ./config.json:/app/plugins/config.json\n```\n**注**：使用docker方式部署的详细教程可以参考：[docker部署CoW项目](https://www.wangpc.cc/ai/docker-deploy-cow/)\n\n\n## 模型说明\n\n以下对所有可支持的模型的配置和使用方法进行说明，模型接口实现在项目的 `bot/` 目录下。\n>部分模型厂商接入有官方sdk和OpenAI兼容两种方式，建议使用OpenAI兼容的方式。\n\n<details>\n<summary>OpenAI</summary>\n\n1.

Simply install quivr-core and add it to your project. You can now ingest your files and ask questions.*\n\n**We will be improving the RAG and adding more features, stay tuned!**\n\n\nThis is the core of Quivr, the brain of Quivr.com.\n\n<!-- ## Demo Highlight 🎥\n\nhttps://github.com/quivrhq/quivr/assets/19614572/a6463b73-76c7-4bc0-978d-70562dca71f5 -->\n\n## Getting Started 🚀\n\nYou can find everything on the [documentation](https://core.quivr.com/).\n\n### Prerequisites 📋\n\nEnsure you have the following installed:\n\n- Python 3.10 or newer\n\n### 30 seconds Installation 💽\n\n\n- **Step 1**: Install the package\n\n  \n\n  ```bash\n  pip install quivr-core # Check that the installation worked\n  ```\n\n\n- **Step 2**: Create a RAG with 5 lines of code\n\n  ```python\n  import tempfile\n\n  from quivr_core import Brain\n\n  if __name__ == "__main__":\n      with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w", suffix=".txt") as temp_file:\n          temp_file.write("Gold is a liquid of blue-like colour.")\n          temp_file.flush()\n\n          brain = Brain.from_files(\n              name="test_brain",\n              file_paths=[temp_file.name],\n          )\n\n          answer = brain.ask(\n              "what is gold? asnwer in french"\n          )\n          print("answer:", answer)\n  ```\n## Configuration\n\n### Workflows\n\n#### Basic RAG\n\n![](docs/docs/workflows/examples/basic_rag.excalidraw.png)\n\n\nCreating a basic RAG workflow like the one above is simple, here are the steps:\n\n\n1. Add your API Keys to your environment variables\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "myopenai_apikey"\n\n```\nQuivr supports APIs from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Mistral. It also supports local models using Ollama.\n\n1. Create the YAML file ``basic_rag_workflow.yaml`` and copy the following content in it\n```yaml\nworkflow_config:\n  name: "standard RAG"\n  nodes:\n    - name: "START"\n      edges: ["filter_history"]\n\n    - name: "filter_history"\n      edges: ["rewrite"]\n\n    - name: "rewrite"\n      edges: ["retrieve"]\n\n    - name: "retrieve"\n      edges: ["generate_rag"]\n\n    - name: "generate_rag" # the name of the last node, from which we want to stream the answer to the user\n      edges: ["END"]\n\n# Maximum number of previous conversation iterations\n# to include in the context of the answer\nmax_history: 10\n\n# Reranker configuration\nreranker_config:\n  # The reranker supplier to use\n  supplier: "cohere"\n\n  # The model to use for the reranker for the given supplier\n  model: "rerank-multilingual-v3.0"\n\n  # Number of chunks returned by the reranker\n  top_n: 5\n\n# Configuration for the LLM\nllm_config:\n\n  # maximum number of tokens passed to the LLM to generate the answer\n  max_input_tokens: 4000\n\n  # temperature for the LLM\n  temperature: 0.7\n```\n\n3. Create a Brain with the default configuration\n```python\nfrom quivr_core import Brain\n\nbrain = Brain.from_files(name = "my smart brain",\n                        file_paths = ["./my_first_doc.pdf", "./my_second_doc.txt"],\n                        )\n\n```\n\n4. Launch a Chat\n```python\nbrain.print_info()\n\nfrom rich.console import Console\nfrom rich.panel import Panel\nfrom rich.prompt import Prompt\nfrom quivr_core.config import RetrievalConfig\n\nconfig_file_name = "./basic_rag_workflow.yaml"\n\nretrieval_config = RetrievalConfig.from_yaml(config_file_name)\n\nconsole = Console()\nconsole.print(Panel.fit("Ask your brain !", style="bold magenta"))\n\nwhile True:\n    # Get user input\n    question = Prompt.ask("[bold cyan]Question[/bold cyan]")\n\n    # Check if user wants to exit\n    if question.lower() == "exit":\n        console.print(Panel("Goodbye!", style="bold yellow"))\n        break\n\n    answer = brain.ask(question, retrieval_config=retrieval_config)\n    # Print the answer with typing effect\n    console.print(f"[bold green]Quivr Assistant[/bold green]: {answer.answer}")\n\n    console.print("-" * console.width)\n\nbrain.print_info()\n```\n\n5. You are now all set up to talk with your brain and test different retrieval strategies by simply changing the configuration file!\n\n## Go further\n\nYou can go further with Quivr by adding internet search, adding tools, etc. Check the [documentation](https://core.quivr.com/) for more information.\n\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks go to these wonderful people:\n<a href="https://github.com/quivrhq/quivr/graphs/contributors">\n<img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=quivrhq/quivr" />\n</a>\n\n## Contribute 🤝\n\nDid you get a pull request?

And yes, you can customize it to your heart''s content.\n\n  * [Using Docker Desktop](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop). This is the fastest and recommended way to get started and have it all running.\n  * [Using Docker](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker). This is also simple, but gives you more flexibility on how to further customize your server.\n\n[MindsDB has an MCP server built in](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mcp/overview) that enables your MCP applications to connect, unify and respond to questions over large-scale federated data—spanning databases, data warehouses, and SaaS applications.\n \n----------------------------------------\n\n# Core Philosophy: Connect, Unify, Respond\n\nMindsDB''s architecture is built around three fundamental capabilities:\n\n## [Connect](https://docs.mindsdb.com/integrations/data-overview) Your Data\n\nYou can connect to hundreds of enterprise [data sources (learn more)](https://docs.mindsdb.com/integrations/data-overview). These integrations allow MindsDB to access data wherever it resides, forming the foundation for all other capabilities.\n\n## [Unify](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/overview) Your Data\n\n\nIn many situations, it’s important to be able to prepare and unify data before generating responses from it. MindsDB SQL offers knowledge bases and views that allow indexing and organizing structured and unstructured data as if it were unified in a single system.\n\n* [**KNOWLEDGE BASES**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/knowledge-bases) – Index and organize unstructured data for efficient Q&A.\n* [**VIEWS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/view) – Simplify data access by creating unified views across different sources (no-ETL).\n\n\nUnification of data can be automated using JOBs\n\n* [**JOBS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs) – Schedule synchronization and transformation tasks for real-time processing.\n\n\n## [Respond](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) From Your Data\n\nChat with Your Data\n\n* [**AGENTS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) – Configure built-in agents specialized in answering questions over your connected and unified data.\n* [**MCP**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mcp/overview) – Connect to MindsDB through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for seamless interaction.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n## 🤝 Contribute\n\nInterested in contributing to MindsDB?

This file is built for AI systems to efficiently parse and reference our documentation.\n\n### IDE Integration\n\nWhen building Agno agents, using Agno documentation as a source in your IDE is a great way to speed up your development. Here''s how to integrate with Cursor:\n\n1. In Cursor, go to the "Cursor Settings" menu.\n2. Find the "Indexing & Docs" section.\n3. Add `https://docs.agno.com/llms-full.txt` to the list of documentation URLs.\n4. Save the changes.\n\nNow, Cursor will have access to the Agno documentation. You can do the same with other IDEs like VSCode, Windsurf etc.\n\n## Performance\n\nIf you''re building with Agno, you''re guaranteed best-in-class performance by default. Our obsession with performance is necessary because even simple AI workflows can spawn hundreds of Agents and because many tasks are long-running -- stateless, horizontal scalability is key for success.\n\nAt Agno, we optimize performance across 3 dimensions:\n\n1. **Agent performance:** We optimize static operations (instantiation, memory footprint) and runtime operations (tool calls, memory updates, history management).\n2. **System performance:** The AgentOS API is async by default and has a minimal memory footprint. The system is stateless and horizontally scalable, with a focus on preventing memory leaks. It handles parallel and batch embedding generation during knowledge ingestion, metrics collection in background tasks, and other system-level optimizations.\n3. **Agent reliability and accuracy:** Monitored through evals, which we''ll explore later.\n\n### Agent Performance\n\nLet''s measure the time it takes to instantiate an Agent and the memory footprint of an Agent. Here are the numbers (last measured in Oct 2025, on an Apple M4 MacBook Pro):\n\n- **Agent instantiation:** ~3μs on average\n- **Memory footprint:** ~6.6Kib on average\n\nWe''ll show below that Agno Agents instantiate **529× faster than Langgraph**, **57× faster than PydanticAI**, and **70× faster than CrewAI**. Agno Agents also use **24× lower memory than Langgraph**, **4× lower than PydanticAI**, and **10× lower than CrewAI**.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Run time performance is bottlenecked by inference and hard to benchmark accurately, so we focus on minimizing overhead, reducing memory usage, and parallelizing tool calls.\n\n### Instantiation Time\n\nLet''s measure instantiation time for an Agent with 1 tool. We''ll run the evaluation 1000 times to get a baseline measurement. We''ll compare Agno to LangGraph, CrewAI and Pydantic AI.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The code for this benchmark is available [here](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/evals/performance). You should run the evaluation yourself on your own machine, please, do not take these results at face value.\n\n```shell\n# Setup virtual environment\n./scripts/perf_setup.sh\nsource .venvs/perfenv/bin/activate\n\n# Agno\npython cookbook/evals/performance/instantiate_agent_with_tool.py\n\n# LangGraph\npython cookbook/evals/performance/comparison/langgraph_instantiation.py\n# CrewAI\npython cookbook/evals/performance/comparison/crewai_instantiation.py\n# Pydantic AI\npython cookbook/evals/performance/comparison/pydantic_ai_instantiation.py\n```\n\nLangGraph is on the right, **let''s start it first and give it a head start**. Then CrewAI and Pydantic AI follow, and finally Agno. Agno obviously finishes first, but let''s see by how much.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54b98576-1859-4880-9f2d-15e1a426719d\n\n### Memory Usage\n\nTo measure memory usage, we use the `tracemalloc` library. We first calculate a baseline memory usage by running an empty function, then run the Agent 1000x times and calculate the difference. This gives a (reasonably) isolated measurement of the memory usage of the Agent.\n\nWe recommend running the evaluation yourself on your own machine, and digging into the code to see how it works. If we''ve made a mistake, please let us know.\n\n### Results\n\nTaking Agno as the baseline, we can see that:\n\n| Metric             | Agno | Langgraph   | PydanticAI | CrewAI     |\n| ------------------ | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| **Time (seconds)** | 1×   | 529× slower | 57× slower | 70× slower |\n| **Memory (MiB)**   | 1×   | 24× higher  | 4× higher  | 10× higher |\n\nExact numbers from the benchmark:\n\n| Metric             | Agno     | Langgraph | PydanticAI | CrewAI   |\n| ------------------ | -------- | --------- | ---------- | -------- |\n| **Time (seconds)** | 0.000003 | 0.001587  | 0.000170   | 0.000210 |\n| **Memory (MiB)**   | 0.006642 | 0.161435  | 0.028712   | 0.065652 |\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Agno agents are designed for performance and while we share benchmarks against other frameworks, we should be mindful that accuracy and reliability are more important than speed.\n\n## Contributions\n\nWe welcome contributions, read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/v2.0/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n\n## Telemetry\n\nAgno logs which model an agent used so we can prioritize updates to the most popular providers.

rapidly.\n\nStay current with the latest features by reviewing the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for all recent changes.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n> AI isn''t a thing; it''s a _magnifier_ of a thing. And that thing is **human creativity**.\n\nWe believe the purpose of technology is to help humans flourish, so when we talk about AI we start with the **human** problems we want to solve.\n\n### Breaking problems into components\n\nOur approach is to break problems into individual pieces (see below) and then apply AI to them one at a time. See below for some examples.\n\n<img width="2078" alt="augmented_challenges" src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/assets/50654/31997394-85a9-40c2-879b-b347e4701f06">\n\n### Too many prompts\n\nPrompts are good for this, but the biggest challenge I faced in 2023——which still exists today—is **the sheer number of AI prompts out there**. We all have prompts that are useful, but it''s hard to discover new ones, know if they are good or not, _and manage different versions of the ones we like_.\n\nOne of `fabric`''s primary features is helping people collect and integrate prompts, which we call _Patterns_, into various parts of their lives.\n\nFabric has Patterns for all sorts of life and work activities, including:\n\n- Extracting the most interesting parts of YouTube videos and podcasts\n- Writing an essay in your own voice with just an idea as an input\n- Summarizing opaque academic papers\n- Creating perfectly matched AI art prompts for a piece of writing\n- Rating the quality of content to see if you want to read/watch the whole thing\n- Getting summaries of long, boring content\n- Explaining code to you\n- Turning bad documentation into usable documentation\n- Creating social media posts from any content input\n- And a million more…\n\n## Installation\n\n### One-Line Install (Recommended)\n\n**Unix/Linux/macOS:**\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/fabric/main/scripts/installer/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n**Windows PowerShell:**\n\n```powershell\niwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/fabric/main/scripts/installer/install.ps1 | iex\n```\n\n> See [scripts/installer/README.md](./scripts/installer/README.md) for custom installation options and troubleshooting.\n\n### Manual Binary Downloads\n\nThe latest release binary archives and their expected SHA256 hashes can be found at <https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/releases/latest>\n\n### Using package managers\n\n**NOTE:** using Homebrew or the Arch Linux package managers makes `fabric` available as `fabric-ai`, so add\nthe following alias to your shell startup files to account for this:\n\n```bash\nalias fabric=''fabric-ai''\n```\n\n#### macOS (Homebrew)\n\n`brew install fabric-ai`\n\n#### Arch Linux (AUR)\n\n`yay -S fabric-ai`\n\n#### Windows\n\nUse the official Microsoft supported `Winget` tool:\n\n`winget install danielmiessler.Fabric`\n\n### From Source\n\nTo install Fabric, [make sure Go is installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), and then run the following command.\n\n```bash\n# Install Fabric directly from the repo\ngo install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/cmd/fabric@latest\n```\n\n### Docker\n\nRun Fabric using pre-built Docker images:\n\n```bash\n# Use latest image from Docker Hub\ndocker run --rm -it kayvan/fabric:latest --version\n\n# Use specific version from GHCR\ndocker run --rm -it ghcr.io/ksylvan/fabric:v1.4.305 --version\n\n# Run setup (first time)\nmkdir -p $HOME/.fabric-config\ndocker run --rm -it -v $HOME/.fabric-config:/root/.config/fabric kayvan/fabric:latest --setup\n\n# Use Fabric with your patterns\ndocker run --rm -it -v $HOME/.fabric-config:/root/.config/fabric kayvan/fabric:latest -p summarize\n\n# Run the REST API server\ndocker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -v $HOME/.fabric-config:/root/.config/fabric kayvan/fabric:latest --serve\n```\n\n**Images available at:**\n\n- Docker Hub: [kayvan/fabric](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kayvan/fabric/general)\n- GHCR: [ksylvan/fabric](https://github.com/ksylvan/fabric/pkgs/container/fabric)\n\nSee [scripts/docker/README.md](./scripts/docker/README.md) for building custom images and advanced configuration.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nYou may need to set some environment variables in your `~/.bashrc` on linux or `~/.zshrc` file on mac to be able to run the `fabric` command. Here is an example of what you can add:\n\nFor Intel based macs or linux\n\n```bash\n# Golang environment variables\nexport GOROOT=/usr/local/go\nexport GOPATH=$HOME/go\n\n# Update PATH to include GOPATH and GOROOT binaries\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\n```\n\nfor Apple Silicon based macs\n\n```bash\n# Golang environment variables\nexport GOROOT=$(brew --prefix go)/libexec\nexport GOPATH=$HOME/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\n```\n\n### Setup\n\nNow run the following command\n\n```bash\n# Run the setup to set up your directories and keys\nfabric --setup\n```\n\nIf everything works you are good to go.\n\n### Per-Pattern Model Mapping\n\n You can configure specific models for individual patterns using environment variables\n like `FABRIC_MODEL_PATTERN_NAME=vendor|model`\n\n This makes it easy to maintain these per-pattern model mappings in your shell startup files.\n\n### Add aliases for all patterns\n\nIn order to add aliases for all your patterns and use them directly as commands, for example, `summarize` instead of `fabric --pattern summarize`\nYou can add the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file. You\ncan also optionally set the `FABRIC_ALIAS_PREFIX` environment variable\nbefore, if you''d prefer all the fabric aliases to start with the same prefix.\n\n```bash\n# Loop through all files in the ~/.config/fabric/patterns directory\nfor pattern_file in $HOME/.config/fabric/patterns/*; do\n    # Get the base name of the file (i.e., remove the directory path)\n    pattern_name="$(basename "$pattern_file")"\n    alias_name="${FABRIC_ALIAS_PREFIX:-}${pattern_name}"\n\n    # Create an alias in the form: alias pattern_name="fabric --pattern pattern_name"\n    alias_command="alias $alias_name=''fabric --pattern $pattern_name''"\n\n    # Evaluate the alias command to add it to the current shell\n    eval "$alias_command"\ndone\n\nyt() {\n    if [ "$#" -eq 0 ] || [ "$#" -gt 2 ]; then\n        echo "Usage: yt [-t | --timestamps] youtube-link"\n        echo "Use the ''-t'' flag to get the transcript with timestamps."\n        return 1\n    fi\n\n    transcript_flag="--transcript"\n    if [ "$1" = "-t" ] || [ "$1" = "--timestamps" ]; then\n        transcript_flag="--transcript-with-timestamps"\n        shift\n    fi\n    local video_link="$1"\n    fabric -y "$video_link" $transcript_flag\n}\n```\n\nYou can add the below code for the equivalent aliases inside PowerShell by running `notepad $PROFILE` inside a PowerShell window:\n\n```powershell\n# Path to the patterns directory\n$patternsPath = Join-Path $HOME ".config/fabric/patterns"\nforeach ($patternDir in Get-ChildItem -Path $patternsPath -Directory) {\n    # Prepend FABRIC_ALIAS_PREFIX if set; otherwise use empty string\n    $prefix = $env:FABRIC_ALIAS_PREFIX ?? ''''\n    $patternName = "$($patternDir.Name)"\n    $aliasName = "$prefix$patternName"\n    # Dynamically define a function for each pattern\n    $functionDefinition = @"\nfunction $aliasName {\n    [CmdletBinding()]\n    param(\n        [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline = `$true)]\n        [string] `$InputObject,\n\n        [Parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments = `$true)]\n        [String[]] `$patternArgs\n    )\n\n    begin {\n        # Initialize an array to collect pipeline input\n        `$collector = @()\n    }\n\n    process {\n        # Collect pipeline input objects\n        if (`$InputObject) {\n            `$collector += `$InputObject\n        }\n    }\n\n    end {\n        # Join all pipeline input into a single string, separated by newlines\n        `$pipelineContent = `$collector -join "`n"\n\n        # If there''s pipeline input, include it in the call to fabric\n        if (`$pipelineContent) {\n            `$pipelineContent | fabric --pattern $patternName `$patternArgs\n        } else {\n            # No pipeline input; just call fabric with the additional args\n            fabric --pattern $patternName `$patternArgs\n        }\n    }\n}\n"@\n    # Add the function to the current session\n    Invoke-Expression $functionDefinition\n}\n\n# Define the ''yt'' function as well\nfunction yt {\n    [CmdletBinding()]\n    param(\n        [Parameter()]\n        [Alias("timestamps")]\n        [switch]$t,\n\n        [Parameter(Position = 0, ValueFromPipeline = $true)]\n        [string]$videoLink\n    )\n\n    begin {\n        $transcriptFlag = "--transcript"\n        if ($t) {\n            $transcriptFlag = "--transcript-with-timestamps"\n        }\n    }\n\n    process {\n        if (-not $videoLink) {\n            Write-Error "Usage: yt [-t | --timestamps] youtube-link"\n            return\n        }\n    }\n\n    end {\n        if ($videoLink) {\n            # Execute and allow output to flow through the pipeline\n            fabric -y $videoLink $transcriptFlag\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis also creates a `yt` alias that allows you to use `yt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b0iet22VIk` to get transcripts, comments, and metadata.\n\n#### Save your files in markdown using aliases\n\nIf in addition to the above aliases you would like to have the option to save the output to your favorite markdown note vault like Obsidian then instead of the above add the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:\n\n```bash\n# Define the base directory for Obsidian notes\nobsidian_base="/path/to/obsidian"\n\n# Loop through all files in the ~/.config/fabric/patterns directory\nfor pattern_file in ~/.config/fabric/patterns/*; do\n    # Get the base name of the file (i.e., remove the directory path)\n    pattern_name=$(basename "$pattern_file")\n\n    # Remove any existing alias with the same name\n    unalias "$pattern_name" 2>/dev/null\n\n    # Define a function dynamically for each pattern\n    eval "\n    $pattern_name() {\n        local title=\$1\n        local date_stamp=\$(date +''%Y-%m-%d'')\n        local output_path=\"\$obsidian_base/\${date_stamp}-\${title}.md\"\n\n        # Check if a title was provided\n        if [ -n \"\$title\" ]; then\n            # If a title is provided, use the output path\n            fabric --pattern \"$pattern_name\" -o \"\$output_path\"\n        else\n            # If no title is provided, use --stream\n            fabric --pattern \"$pattern_name\" --stream\n        fi\n    }\n    "\ndone\n```\n\nThis will allow you to use the patterns as aliases like in the above for example `summarize` instead of `fabric --pattern summarize --stream`, however if you pass in an extra argument like this `summarize "my_article_title"` your output will be saved in the destination that you set in `obsidian_base="/path/to/obsidian"` in the following format `YYYY-MM-DD-my_article_title.md` where the date gets autogenerated for you.\nYou can tweak the date format by tweaking the `date_stamp` format.\n\n### Migration\n\nIf you have the Legacy (Python) version installed and want to migrate to the Go version, here''s how you do it. It''s basically two steps: 1) uninstall the Python version, and 2) install the Go version.\n\n```bash\n# Uninstall Legacy Fabric\npipx uninstall fabric\n\n# Clear any old Fabric aliases\n(check your .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)\n# Install the Go version\ngo install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/cmd/fabric@latest\n# Run setup for the new version. Important because things have changed\nfabric --setup\n```\n\nThen [set your environmental variables](#environment-variables) as shown above.\n\n### Upgrading\n\nThe great thing about Go is that it''s super easy to upgrade. Just run the same command you used to install it in the first place and you''ll always get the latest version.\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/cmd/fabric@latest\n```\n\n### Shell Completions\n\nFabric provides shell completion scripts for Zsh, Bash, and Fish\nshells, making it easier to use the CLI by providing tab completion\nfor commands and options.\n\n#### Quick install (no clone required)\n\nYou can install completions directly via a one-liner:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/refs/heads/main/completions/setup-completions.sh | sh\n```\n\nOptional variants:\n\n```bash\n# Dry-run (see actions without changing your system)\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/refs/heads/main/completions/setup-completions.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run\n\n# Override the download source (advanced)\nFABRIC_COMPLETIONS_BASE_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/refs/heads/main/completions" \\n    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/refs/heads/main/completions/setup-completions.sh)"\n```\n\n#### Zsh Completion\n\nTo enable Zsh completion:\n\n```bash\n# Copy the completion file to a directory in your $fpath\nmkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions\ncp completions/_fabric ~/.zsh/completions/\n\n# Add the directory to fpath in your .zshrc before compinit\necho ''fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)'' >> ~/.zshrc\necho ''autoload -Uz compinit && compinit'' >> ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n#### Bash Completion\n\nTo enable Bash completion:\n\n```bash\n# Source the completion script in your .bashrc\necho ''source /path/to/fabric/completions/fabric.bash'' >> ~/.bashrc\n\n# Or copy to the system-wide bash completion directory\nsudo cp completions/fabric.bash /etc/bash_completion.d/\n```\n\n#### Fish Completion\n\nTo enable Fish completion:\n\n```bash\n# Copy the completion file to the fish completions directory\nmkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions\ncp completions/fabric.fish ~/.config/fish/completions/\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce you have it all set up, here''s how to use it.\n\n```bash\nfabric -h\n```\n\n```plaintext\nUsage:\n  fabric [OPTIONS]\n\nApplication Options:\n  -p, --pattern=                    Choose a pattern from the available patterns\n  -v, --variable=                   Values for pattern variables, e.g. -v=#role:expert -v=#points:30\n  -C, --context=                    Choose a context from the available contexts\n      --session=                    Choose a session from the available sessions\n  -a, --attachment=                 Attachment path or URL (e.g. for OpenAI image recognition messages)\n  -S, --setup                       Run setup for all reconfigurable parts of fabric\n  -t, --temperature=                Set temperature (default: 0.7)\n  -T, --topp=                       Set top P (default: 0.9)\n  -s, --stream                      Stream\n  -P, --presencepenalty=            Set presence penalty (default: 0.0)\n  -r, --raw                         Use the defaults of the model without sending chat options\n                                    (temperature, top_p, etc.).

Extensions\n\nFabric supports extensions that can be called within patterns. See the [Extension Guide](internal/plugins/template/Examples/README.md) for complete documentation.\n\n**Important:** Extensions only work within pattern files, not via direct stdin. See the guide for details and examples.\n\n## Our approach to prompting\n\nFabric _Patterns_ are different than most prompts you''ll see.\n\n- **First, we use `Markdown` to help ensure maximum readability and editability**. This not only helps the creator make a good one, but also anyone who wants to deeply understand what it does. _Importantly, this also includes the AI you''re sending it to!_\n\nHere''s an example of a Fabric Pattern.\n\n```bash\nhttps://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/blob/main/data/patterns/extract_wisdom/system.md\n```\n\n<img width="1461" alt="pattern-example" src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/assets/50654/b910c551-9263-405f-9735-71ca69bbab6d">\n\n- **Next, we are extremely clear in our instructions**, and we use the Markdown structure to emphasize what we want the AI to do, and in what order.\n\n- **And finally, we tend to use the System section of the prompt almost exclusively**. In over a year of being heads-down with this stuff, we''ve just seen more efficacy from doing that. If that changes, or we''re shown data that says otherwise, we will adjust.\n\n## Examples\n\n> The following examples use the macOS `pbpaste` to paste from the clipboard. See the [pbpaste](#pbpaste) section below for Windows and Linux alternatives.\n\nNow let''s look at some things you can do with Fabric.\n\n1. Run the `summarize` Pattern based on input from `stdin`. In this case, the body of an article.\n\n    ```bash\n    pbpaste | fabric --pattern summarize\n    ```\n\n2. Run the `analyze_claims` Pattern with the `--stream` option to get immediate and streaming results.\n\n    ```bash\n    pbpaste | fabric --stream --pattern analyze_claims\n    ```\n\n3. Run the `extract_wisdom` Pattern with the `--stream` option to get immediate and streaming results from any      Youtube video (much like in the original introduction video).\n\n    ```bash\n    fabric -y "https://youtube.com/watch?v=uXs-zPc63kM" --stream --pattern extract_wisdom\n    ```\n\n4. Create patterns- you must create a .md file with the pattern and save it to `~/.config/fabric/patterns/[yourpatternname]`.\n\n5. Run a `analyze_claims` pattern on a website. Fabric uses Jina AI to scrape the URL into markdown format before sending it to the model.\n\n    ```bash\n    fabric -u https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/ -p analyze_claims\n    ```\n\n## Just use the Patterns\n\n<img width="1173" alt="fabric-patterns-screenshot" src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/assets/50654/9186a044-652b-4673-89f7-71cf066f32d8">\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\nIf you''re not looking to do anything fancy, and you just want a lot of great prompts, you can navigate to the [`/patterns`](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main/data/patterns) directory and start exploring!\n\nWe hope that if you used nothing else from Fabric, the Patterns by themselves will make the project useful.\n\nYou can use any of the Patterns you see there in any AI application that you have, whether that''s ChatGPT or some other app or website. Our plan and prediction is that people will soon be sharing many more than those we''ve published, and they will be way better than ours.\n\nThe wisdom of crowds for the win.\n\n### Prompt Strategies\n\nFabric also implements prompt strategies like "Chain of Thought" or "Chain of Draft" which can\nbe used in addition to the basic patterns.\n\nSee the [Thinking Faster by Writing Less](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18600) paper and\nthe [Thought Generation section of Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/advanced/thought_generation/introduction) for examples of prompt strategies.\n\nEach strategy is available as a small `json` file in the [`/strategies`](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main/data/strategies) directory.\n\nThe prompt modification of the strategy is applied to the system prompt and passed on to the\nLLM in the chat session.\n\nUse `fabric -S` and select the option to install the strategies in your `~/.config/fabric` directory.\n\n## Custom Patterns\n\nYou may want to use Fabric to create your own custom Patterns—but not share them with others. No problem!\n\nFabric now supports a dedicated custom patterns directory that keeps your personal patterns separate from the built-in ones. This means your custom patterns won''t be overwritten when you update Fabric''s built-in patterns.\n\n### Setting Up Custom Patterns\n\n1. Run the Fabric setup:\n\n   ```bash\n   fabric --setup\n   ```\n\n2. Select the "Custom Patterns" option from the Tools menu and enter your desired directory path (e.g., `~/my-custom-patterns`)\n\n3. Fabric will automatically create the directory if it does not exist.\n\n### Using Custom Patterns\n\n1. Create your custom pattern directory structure:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p ~/my-custom-patterns/my-analyzer\n   ```\n\n2. Create your pattern file\n\n   ```bash\n   echo "You are an expert analyzer of ..." > ~/my-custom-patterns/my-analyzer/system.md\n   ```\n\n3. **Use your custom pattern:**\n\n   ```bash\n   fabric --pattern my-analyzer "analyze this text"\n   ```\n\n### How It Works\n\n- **Priority System**: Custom patterns take precedence over built-in patterns with the same name\n- **Seamless Integration**: Custom patterns appear in `fabric --listpatterns` alongside built-in ones\n- **Update Safe**: Your custom patterns are never affected by `fabric --updatepatterns`\n- **Private by Default**: Custom patterns remain private unless you explicitly share them\n\nYour custom patterns are completely private and won''t be affected by Fabric updates!\n\n## Helper Apps\n\nFabric also makes use of some core helper apps (tools) to make it easier to integrate with your various workflows. Here are some examples:\n\n### `to_pdf`\n\n`to_pdf` is a helper command that converts LaTeX files to PDF format. You can use it like this:\n\n```bash\nto_pdf input.tex\n```\n\nThis will create a PDF file from the input LaTeX file in the same directory.\n\nYou can also use it with stdin which works perfectly with the `write_latex` pattern:\n\n```bash\necho "ai security primer" | fabric --pattern write_latex | to_pdf\n```\n\nThis will create a PDF file named `output.pdf` in the current directory.\n\n### `to_pdf` Installation\n\nTo install `to_pdf`, install it the same way as you install Fabric, just with a different repo name.\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/cmd/to_pdf@latest\n```\n\nMake sure you have a LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live or MiKTeX) installed on your system, as `to_pdf` requires `pdflatex` to be available in your system''s PATH.\n\n### `code_helper`\n\n`code_helper` is used in conjunction with the `create_coding_feature` pattern.\nIt generates a `json` representation of a directory of code that can be fed into an AI model\nwith instructions to create a new feature or edit the code in a specified way.\n\nSee [the Create Coding Feature Pattern README](./data/patterns/create_coding_feature/README.md) for details.\n\nInstall it first using:\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/cmd/code_helper@latest\n```\n\n## pbpaste\n\nThe [examples](#examples) use the macOS program `pbpaste` to paste content from the clipboard to pipe into `fabric` as the input. `pbpaste` is not available on Windows or Linux, but there are alternatives.\n\nOn Windows, you can use the PowerShell command `Get-Clipboard` from a PowerShell command prompt. If you like, you can also alias it to `pbpaste`. If you are using classic PowerShell, edit the file `~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\.profile.ps1`, or if you are using PowerShell Core, edit `~\Documents\PowerShell\.profile.ps1` and add the alias,\n\n```powershell\nSet-Alias pbpaste Get-Clipboard\n```\n\nOn Linux, you can use `xclip -selection clipboard -o` to paste from the clipboard. You will likely need to install `xclip` with your package manager. For Debian based systems including Ubuntu,\n\n```sh\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install xclip -y\n```\n\nYou can also create an alias by editing `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` and adding the alias,\n\n```sh\nalias pbpaste=''xclip -selection clipboard -o''\n```\n\n## Web Interface (Fabric Web App)\n\nFabric now includes a built-in web interface that provides a GUI alternative to the command-line interface. Refer to [Web App README](/web/README.md) for installation instructions and an overview of features.\n\n## Meta\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Special thanks to the following people for their inspiration and contributions!\n\n- _Jonathan Dunn_ for being the absolute MVP dev on the project, including spearheading the new Go version, as well as the GUI! All this while also being a full-time medical doctor!\n- _Caleb Sima_ for pushing me over the edge of whether to make this a public project or not.\n- _Eugen Eisler_ and _Frederick Ros_ for their invaluable contributions to the Go version\n- _David Peters_ for his work on the web interface.\n- _Joel Parish_ for super useful input on the project''s Github directory structure..\n- _Joseph Thacker_ for the idea of a `-c` context flag that adds pre-created context in the `./config/fabric/` directory to all Pattern queries.\n- _Jason Haddix_ for the idea of a stitch (chained Pattern) to filter content using a local model before sending on to a cloud model, i.e., cleaning customer data using `llama2` before sending on to `gpt-4` for analysis.\n- _Andre Guerra_ for assisting with numerous components to make things simpler and more maintainable.\n\n### Primary contributors\n\n<a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler"><img

Set your key and other settings in `config.json` file:\n   - LLM Provider (`openai`, `anthropic` or `groq`) key and endpoints (leave `null` for default) (note that Azure and OpenRouter are suppored via the `openai` setting)\n   - Your API key (if `null`, will be read from the environment variables)\n   - database settings: sqlite is used by default, PostgreSQL should also work\n   - optionally update `fs.ignore_paths` and add files or folders which shouldn''t be tracked by GPT Pilot in workspace, useful to ignore folders created by compilers\n8. `python main.py` (start GPT Pilot)\n\nAll generated code will be stored in the folder `workspace` inside the folder named after the app name you enter upon starting the pilot.\n\n# 🔎 [Examples](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot/wiki/Apps-created-with-GPT-Pilot)\n\n[Click here](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot/wiki/Apps-created-with-GPT-Pilot) to see all example apps created with GPT Pilot.\n\n### PostgreSQL support\n\nGPT Pilot uses built-in SQLite database by default. If you want to use the PostgreSQL database, you need to additional install `asyncpg` and `psycopg2` packages:\n\n```bash\npip install asyncpg psycopg2\n```\n\nThen, you need to update the `config.json` file to set `db.url` to `postgresql+asyncpg://<user>:<password>@<db-host>/<db-name>`.\n\n# 🧑‍💻️ CLI arguments\n\n### List created projects (apps)\n\n```bash\npython main.py --list\n```\n\nNote: for each project (app), this also lists "branches". Currently we only support having one branch (called "main"), and in the future we plan to add support for multiple project branches.\n\n### Load and continue from the latest step in a project (app)\n\n```bash\npython main.py --project <app_id>\n```\n\n### Load and continue from a specific step in a project (app)\n\n```bash\npython main.py --project <app_id> --step <step>\n```\n\nWarning: this will delete all progress after the specified step!\n\n### Delete project (app)\n\n```bash\npython main.py --delete <app_id>\n```\n\nDelete project with the specified `app_id`. Warning: this cannot be undone!\n\n### Other command-line options\n\nThere are several other command-line options that mostly support calling GPT Pilot from our VSCode extension. To see all the available options, use the `--help` flag:\n\n```bash\npython main.py --help\n```\n\n# 🏗 How GPT Pilot works?\nHere are the steps GPT Pilot takes to create an app:\n\n1. You enter the app name and the description.\n2. **Product Owner agent** like in real life, does nothing. :)\n3. **Specification Writer agent** asks a couple of questions to understand the requirements better if project description is not good enough.\n4. **Architect agent** writes up technologies that will be used for the app and checks if all technologies are installed on the machine and installs them if not.\n5. **Tech Lead agent** writes up development tasks that the Developer must implement.\n6. **Developer agent** takes each task and writes up what needs to be done to implement it. The description is in human-readable form.\n7. **Code Monkey agent** takes the Developer''s description and the existing file and implements the changes.\n8. **Reviewer agent** reviews every step of the task and if something is done wrong Reviewer sends it back to Code Monkey.\n9. **Troubleshooter agent** helps you to give good feedback to GPT Pilot when something is wrong.\n10. **Debugger agent** hate to see him, but he is your best friend when things go south.\n11. **Technical Writer agent** writes documentation for the project.\n\n<br>\n\n# 🕴How''s GPT Pilot different from _Smol developer_ and _GPT engineer_?\n\n- **GPT Pilot works with the developer to create a fully working production-ready app** - I don''t think AI can (at least in the near future) create apps without a developer being involved. So, **GPT Pilot codes the app step by step** just like a developer would in real life. This way, it can debug issues as they arise throughout the development process. If it gets stuck, you, the developer in charge, can review the code and fix the issue. Other similar tools give you the entire codebase at once - this way, bugs are much harder to fix for AI and for you as a developer.\n  <br><br>\n- **Works at scale** - GPT Pilot isn''t meant to create simple apps but rather so it can work at any scale. It has mechanisms that filter out the code, so in each LLM conversation, it doesn''t need to store the entire codebase in context, but it shows the LLM only the relevant code for the current task it''s working on. Once an app is finished, you can continue working on it by writing instructions on what feature you want to add.\n\n# 🍻 Contributing\nIf you are interested in contributing to GPT Pilot, join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/HaqXugmxr9), check out open [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot/issues), and see if anything interests you. We would be happy to get help in resolving any of those. The best place to start is by reviewing blog posts mentioned above to understand how the architecture works before diving into the codebase.\n\n## 🖥 Development\nOther than the research, GPT Pilot needs to be debugged to work in different scenarios. For example, we realized that the quality of the code generated is very sensitive to the size of the development task. When the task is too broad, the code has too many bugs that are hard to fix, but when the development task is too narrow, GPT also seems to struggle in getting the task implemented into the existing code.\n\n## 📊 Telemetry\nTo improve GPT Pilot, we are tracking some events from which you can opt out at any time.

.NET\n\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.SemanticKernel;\nusing Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Agents;\n\nvar builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();\nbuilder.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(\n                Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT"),\n                Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),\n                Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")\n                );\nvar kernel = builder.Build();\n\nChatCompletionAgent agent =\n    new()\n    {\n        Name = "SK-Agent",\n        Instructions = "You are a helpful assistant.",\n        Kernel = kernel,\n    };\n\nawait foreach (AgentResponseItem<ChatMessageContent> response \n    in agent.InvokeAsync("Write a haiku about Semantic Kernel."))\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(response.Message);\n}\n\n// Output:\n// Language''s essence,\n// Semantic threads intertwine,\n// Meaning''s core revealed.\n```\n\n### Agent with Plugins - Python\n\nEnhance your agent with custom tools (plugins) and structured output:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom semantic_kernel.agents import ChatCompletionAgent\nfrom semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion, OpenAIChatPromptExecutionSettings\nfrom semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_function, KernelArguments\n\nclass MenuPlugin:\n    @kernel_function(description="Provides a list of specials from the menu.")\n    def get_specials(self) -> Annotated[str, "Returns the specials from the menu."]:\n        return """\n        Special Soup: Clam Chowder\n        Special Salad: Cobb Salad\n        Special Drink: Chai Tea\n        """\n\n    @kernel_function(description="Provides the price of the requested menu item.")\n    def get_item_price(\n        self, menu_item: Annotated[str, "The name of the menu item."]\n    ) -> Annotated[str, "Returns the price of the menu item."]:\n        return "$9.99"\n\nclass MenuItem(BaseModel):\n    price: float\n    name: str\n\nasync def main():\n    # Configure structured output format\n    settings = OpenAIChatPromptExecutionSettings()\n    settings.response_format = MenuItem\n\n    # Create agent with plugin and settings\n    agent = ChatCompletionAgent(\n        service=AzureChatCompletion(),\n        name="SK-Assistant",\n        instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",\n        plugins=[MenuPlugin()],\n        arguments=KernelArguments(settings)\n    )\n\n    response = await agent.get_response(messages="What is the price of the soup special?")\n    print(response.content)\n\n    # Output:\n    # The price of the Clam Chowder, which is the soup special, is $9.99.\n\nasyncio.run(main()) \n```\n\n### Agent with Plugin - .NET\n\n```csharp\nusing System.ComponentModel;\nusing Microsoft.SemanticKernel;\nusing Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Agents;\nusing Microsoft.SemanticKernel.ChatCompletion;\n\nvar builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();\nbuilder.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(\n                Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT"),\n                Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),\n                Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")\n                );\nvar kernel = builder.Build();\n\nkernel.Plugins.Add(KernelPluginFactory.CreateFromType<MenuPlugin>());\n\nChatCompletionAgent agent =\n    new()\n    {\n        Name = "SK-Assistant",\n        Instructions = "You are a helpful assistant.",\n        Kernel = kernel,\n        Arguments = new KernelArguments(new PromptExecutionSettings() { FunctionChoiceBehavior = FunctionChoiceBehavior.Auto() })\n\n    };\n\nawait foreach (AgentResponseItem<ChatMessageContent> response \n    in agent.InvokeAsync("What is the price of the soup special?"))\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(response.Message);\n}\n\nsealed class MenuPlugin\n{\n    [KernelFunction, Description("Provides a list of specials from the menu.")]\n    public string GetSpecials() =>\n        """\n        Special Soup: Clam Chowder\n        Special Salad: Cobb Salad\n        Special Drink: Chai Tea\n        """;\n\n    [KernelFunction, Description("Provides the price of the requested menu item.")]\n    public string GetItemPrice(\n        [Description("The name of the menu item.")]\n        string menuItem) =>\n        "$9.99";\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-Agent System - Python\n\nBuild a system of specialized agents that can collaborate:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom semantic_kernel.agents import ChatCompletionAgent, ChatHistoryAgentThread\nfrom semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion, OpenAIChatCompletion\n\nbilling_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(\n    service=AzureChatCompletion(), \n    name="BillingAgent", \n    instructions="You handle billing issues like charges, payment methods, cycles, fees, discrepancies, and payment failures."\n)\n\nrefund_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(\n    service=AzureChatCompletion(),\n    name="RefundAgent",\n    instructions="Assist users with refund inquiries, including eligibility, policies, processing, and status updates.",\n)\n\ntriage_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(\n    service=OpenAIChatCompletion(),\n    name="TriageAgent",\n    instructions="Evaluate user requests and forward them to BillingAgent or RefundAgent for targeted assistance."\n    " Provide the full answer to the user containing any information from the agents",\n    plugins=[billing_agent, refund_agent],\n)\n\nthread: ChatHistoryAgentThread = None\n\nasync def main() -> None:\n    print("Welcome to the chat bot!\n  Type ''exit'' to exit.\n  Try to get some billing or refund help.")\n    while True:\n        user_input = input("User:> ")\n\n        if user_input.lower().strip() == "exit":\n            print("\n\nExiting chat...")\n            return False\n\n        response = await triage_agent.get_response(\n            messages=user_input,\n            thread=thread,\n        )\n\n        if response:\n            print(f"Agent :> {response}")\n\n# Agent :> I understand that you were charged twice for your subscription last month, and I''m here to assist you with resolving this issue. Here’s what we need to do next:\n\n# 1. **Billing Inquiry**:\n#    - Please provide the email address or account number associated with your subscription, the date(s) of the charges, and the amount charged. This will allow the billing team to investigate the discrepancy in the charges.\n\n# 2. **Refund Process**:\n#    - For the refund, please confirm your subscription type and the email address associated with your account.\n#    - Provide the dates and transaction IDs for the charges you believe were duplicated.\n\n# Once we have these details, we will be able to:\n\n# - Check your billing history for any discrepancies.\n# - Confirm any duplicate charges.\n# - Initiate a refund for the duplicate payment if it qualifies. The refund process usually takes 5-10 business days after approval.\n\n# Please provide the necessary details so we can proceed with resolving this issue for you.\n\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n\n\n## Where to Go Next\n\n1. 📖 Try our [Getting Started Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/quick-start-guide) or learn about [Building Agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/)\n2. 🔌 Explore over 100 [Detailed Samples](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/detailed-samples)\n3. 💡 Learn about core Semantic Kernel [Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/kernel)\n\n### API References\n\n- [C# API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel?view=semantic-kernel-dotnet)\n- [Python API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/semantic-kernel/semantic_kernel?view=semantic-kernel-python)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n- **Authentication Errors**: Check that your API key environment variables are correctly set\n- **Model Availability**: Verify your Azure OpenAI deployment or OpenAI model access\n\n### Getting Help\n\n- Check our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/issues) for known problems\n- Search the [Discord community](https://aka.ms/SKDiscord) for solutions\n- Include your SDK version and full error messages when asking for help\n\n\n## Join the community\n\nWe welcome your contributions and suggestions to the SK community!

It tells the adventures of Kratos becoming a god of war from a mortal and launching a god-killing slaughter.\n\nKratos is a microservice-oriented governance framework implemented by golang, which offers convenient capabilities to help you quickly build a bulletproof application from scratch, such as:\n\n- The [communication protocol](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/api) is based on the HTTP/gRPC through the definition of Protobuf.\n- Abstract [transport](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/transport/overview) layer support: [HTTP](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/transport/http) / [gRPC](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/transport/grpc).\n- Powerful [middleware](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/middleware/overview) design, support: [Tracing (OpenTelemetry)](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/middleware/tracing), [Metrics (Prometheus is default)](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/middleware/metrics), [Recovery](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/middleware/recovery) and more.\n- [Registry](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/registry) interface able to be connected with various other centralized registries through plug-ins.\n- The [standard log interfaces](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/log) ease the integration of the third-party log libs with logs collected through the *Fluentd*.\n- Automatically support the selection of the content [encoding](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/encoding) with Accept and Content-Type.\n- Multiple data sources are supported for [configurations](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/config) and dynamic configurations (use atomic operations).\n- In the protocol of HTTP/gRPC, use the uniform [metadata](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/metadata) transfer method.\n- You can define [errors](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/errors/) in protos and generate enums with protoc-gen-go.\n- You can define [verification rules](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/component/middleware/validate) in Protobuf supported by the HTTP/gRPC service.\n- [Swagger API](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/guide/openapi) is generated Automatically and embed Swagger UI endpoint can be started by adding [Swagger plugin](https://github.com/go-kratos/swagger-api).\n\nKratos is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.\n\n## Learning Kratos\n\nKratos has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/getting-started/start) and [example](https://github.com/go-kratos/examples) library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.\n\nWe also provide a [modern template](https://github.com/go-kratos/kratos-layout). This template should help reduce the work required to set up modern projects.\n\n### Goals\n\nKratos boosts your productivity. With the integration of excellent resources and further support, programmers can get rid of most issues might encounter in the field of distributed systems and software engineering such that they are allowed to focus on the release of businesses only. Additionally, for each programmer, Kratos is also an ideal one learning warehouse for many aspects of microservices to enrich their experiences and skills.\n\n### Principles\n\n* **Simple**: Appropriate design with plain and easy code.\n* **General**: Cover the various utilities for business development.\n* **Highly efficient**: Speeding up the efficiency of businesses upgrading.\n* **Stable**: The base libs validated in the production environment have the characteristics of high testability, high coverage as well as high security and reliability.\n* **Robust**: Eliminating misusing through high quality of the base libs.\n* **High-performance**: Optimal performance excluding the optimization of hacking in case of *unsafe*. \n* **Expandability**: Properly designed interfaces where you can expand utilities such as base libs to meet your further requirements.\n* **Fault-tolerance**: Designed against failure, enhance the understanding and exercising of SRE within Kratos to achieve more robustness.\n* **Toolchain**: Includes an extensive toolchain, such as the code generation of cache, the lint tool, and so forth.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nCreate a kratos playground through [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop):\n\n```shell\ndocker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 --workdir /workspace golang\n```\n\n```shell\napt-get update && apt-get -y install protobuf-compiler\nexport GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io,direct\ngo install github.com/go-kratos/kratos/cmd/kratos/v2@latest && kratos upgrade\n```\n\n```shell\nkratos new helloworld\ncd helloworld/ && go mod tidy\nkratos run\n```\n\nUse a browser to open and visit: `http://localhost:8000/helloworld/kratos`, The kratos program is running!\n\nIf you need more, please visit the kratos [documentation](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/getting-started/start).\n\n## Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIf you discover a security vulnerability within Kratos, please send an e-mail to tonybase via go-kratos@googlegroups.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.\n\n## Community\n\n- [Wechat Group](https://github.com/go-kratos/kratos/issues/682)\n- [Discord Group](https://discord.gg/BWzJsUJ)\n- [go-kratos.dev](https://go-kratos.dev/en)\n\n## Contributors\n\nThank you for considering contributing to the Kratos framework!

It''s extremely fast, cost-effective, scalable and painless. Create a DB and try it out in under 30 seconds with $5 of free credits.\n\n[Get started with Chroma Cloud](https://trychroma.com/signup)\n\n## API\n\nThe core API is only 4 functions (run our [💡 Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing)):\n\n```python\nimport chromadb\n# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!\nclient = chromadb.Client()\n\n# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!\ncollection = client.create_collection("all-my-documents")\n\n# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!\ncollection.add(\n    documents=["This is document1", "This is document2"], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well\n    metadatas=[{"source": "notion"}, {"source": "google-docs"}], # filter on these!\n    ids=["doc1", "doc2"], # unique for each doc\n)\n\n# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id\nresults = collection.query(\n    query_texts=["This is a query document"],\n    n_results=2,\n    # where={"metadata_field": "is_equal_to_this"}, # optional filter\n    # where_document={"$contains":"search_string"}  # optional filter\n)\n```\n\nLearn about all features on our [Docs](https://docs.trychroma.com)\n\n## Features\n- __Simple__: Fully-typed, fully-tested, fully-documented == happiness\n- __Integrations__: [`🦜️🔗 LangChain`](https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-chroma/) (python and js), [`🦙 LlamaIndex`](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1628557389762007040) and more soon\n- __Dev, Test, Prod__: the same API that runs in your python notebook, scales to your cluster\n- __Feature-rich__: Queries, filtering, regex and more\n- __Free & Open Source__: Apache 2.0 Licensed\n\n## Use case: ChatGPT for ______\n\nFor example, the `"Chat your data"` use case:\n1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.\n2. Query relevant documents with natural language.\n3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT4` for additional summarization or analysis.\n\n## Embeddings?\n\nWhat are embeddings?\n\n- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)\n- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 => `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents "understandable" to a machine learning model.\n- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be "near" each other and therefore easy to find.\n- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.\n- __A small example__: If you search your photos for "famous bridge in San Francisco". By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nEmbeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.\n\n## Get involved\n\nChroma is a rapidly developing project. We welcome PR contributors and ideas for how to improve the project.\n- [Join the conversation on Discord](https://discord.gg/MMeYNTmh3x) - `#contributing` channel\n- [Review the 🛣️ Roadmap and contribute your ideas](https://docs.trychroma.com/roadmap)\n- [Grab an issue and open a PR](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues) - [`Good first issue tag`](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\n- [Read our contributing guide](https://docs.trychroma.com/contributing)\n\n**Release Cadence**\nWe currently release new tagged versions of the `pypi` and `npm` packages on Mondays.
