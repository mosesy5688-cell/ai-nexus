For example:\n\n```python\nimport transformers\n\nname = ''mosaicml/mpt-7b''\n\nconfig = transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained(name, trust_remote_code=True)\nconfig.max_seq_len = 4096 # (input + output) tokens can now be up to 4096\n\nmodel = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n  name,\n  config=config,\n  trust_remote_code=True\n)\n```\n\nThis model was trained with the [EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) tokenizer.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(''EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b'')\n```\n\nThe model can then be used, for example, within a text-generation pipeline.  \nNote: when running Torch modules in lower precision, it is best practice to use the [torch.autocast context manager](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html).\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline(''text-generation'', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device=''cuda:0'')\n\nwith torch.autocast(''cuda'', dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n    print(\n        pipe(''Here is a recipe for vegan banana bread:\n'',\n            max_new_tokens=100,\n            do_sample=True,\n            use_cache=True))\n```\n\n## Model Description\n\nThe architecture is a modification of a standard decoder-only transformer.\n\nThe model has been modified from a standard transformer in the following ways:\n* It uses [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf)\n* It uses [ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409) and does not use positional embeddings\n* It does not use biases\n\n\n| Hyperparameter | Value |\n|----------------|-------|\n|n_parameters | 6.7B |\n|n_layers | 32 |\n| n_heads | 32 |\n| d_model | 4096 |\n| vocab size | 50432 |\n| sequence length | 2048 |\n\n\n\n## Training Data\n\n### Streaming Datasets\n\nData was formatted using the MosaicML [StreamingDataset](https://github.com/mosaicml/streaming) library to host our data in object storage and efficiently stream it to our compute cluster during training.\nStreamingDataset obviates the need to download the whole dataset before starting training, and allows instant resumption of training from any point in the dataset.\n\n\n### Data Mix\n\nThe model was trained for 1T tokens (with batch size 1760 and sequence length 2048). It was trained on the following data mix:\n\n\n| Data Source | Number of Tokens in Source | Proportion | Effective Number of Tokens | Epochs |\n|-------------|----------------------------|------------|----------------------------|--------|\n| mC4 3.1.0 - English | 417.99 B | 0.33 | 330 B | 0.14 |\n| C4 - English - SemDedup 80% | 100.42 B | 0.299 | 299 B | 2.98 |\n| RedPajama - CommonCrawl | 878.45 B | 0.1 | 100 B | 0.11 |\n| The Stack - Selected Languages | 463.78 B | 0.1 | 100 B | 0.22 |\n| RedPajama - Wikipedia - En | 4.87 B | 0.04 | 40 B | 8.21 |\n| The Stack - Markdown | 107.07 B | 0.035 | 35 B | 0.33 |\n| S2ORC | 48.85 B | 0.033 | 33 B | 0.68 |\n| RedPajama - Books | 26.02 B | 0.03 | 30B | 1.15 |\n| RedPajama - arXiv | 28.10 B | 0.019 | 19 B | 0.68 |\n| RedPajama - StackExchange | 20.54 B | 0.014 | 14 B |0.68 |\n\nSamples for each batch were selected from one of the datasets with the probability specified above.\nThe examples were shuffled within each dataset, and each example was constructed from as many sequences from that dataset as were necessary to fill the 2048 sequence length.\n\nThe data was tokenized using the [EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) tokenizer. This BPE tokenizer has a number of desirable characteristics,\nmost of which are relevant for tokenizing code:\n(1) It was trained on a diverse mix of data that includes code (The Pile)\n(2) It applies consistent space delimitation, unlike the GPT2 tokenizer which tokenizes inconsistently depending on the presence of prefix spaces\n(3) It contains tokens for repeated space characters, which allows superior compression of text with large amounts of repeated space characters.\n\nThe model vocabulary size of 50432 was set to be a multiple of 128 (as in [MEGATRON-LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053)), model flop utilization (MFU) increased by up to four percentage points.\n\n### Training Configuration\n\nThis model was trained on 440 A100-40GBs for about 9.5 days using the [MosaicML Platform](https://www.mosaicml.com/platform).\nThe model was trained with sharded data parallelism using [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html) and used the [LION](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06675) optimizer.\n\n## Limitations and Biases\n\n_The following language is modified from [EleutherAI''s GPT-NeoX-20B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b)_\n\nMPT-7B (Base) is **not** intended for deployment without finetuning.\nIt should not be used for human-facing interactions without further guardrails and user consent.\n\nMPT-7B can produce factually incorrect output, and should not be relied on to produce factually accurate information.\nMPT-7B was trained on various public datasets.\nWhile great efforts have been taken to clean the pretraining data, it is possible that this model could generate lewd, biased or otherwise offensive outputs.\n\n\n## MosaicML Platform\n\nIf you''re interested in [training](https://www.mosaicml.com/training) and [deploying](https://www.mosaicml.com/inference) your own MPT or LLMs on the MosaicML Platform, [sign up here](https://forms.mosaicml.com/demo?utm_source=huggingface&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mpt-7b).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe license on this model does not constitute legal advice.

BAGEL outperforms the current top‑tier open‑source VLMs like Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL-2.5 on standard multimodal understanding leaderboards, and delivers text‑to‑image quality that is competitive with strong specialist generators such as SD3.\nMoreover, BAGEL demonstrates superior qualitative results in classical image‑editing scenarios than the leading open-source models. More importantly, it extends to free-form visual manipulation, multiview synthesis, and world navigation, capabilities that constitute "world-modeling" tasks beyond the scope of previous image-editing models.\n\n\nThis repository hosts the model weights for **BAGEL**. For installation, usage instructions, and further documentation, please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bytedance-seed/BAGEL).\n\n\n\n<p align="left"><img src="https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Bagel/raw/main/assets/teaser.webp" width="80%"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 🧠 Method\nBAGEL adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer-Experts (MoT) architecture to maximize the model’s capacity to learn from richly diverse multimodal information. Following the same principle of capacity maximization, it utilizes two separate encoders to capture pixel-level and semantic-level features of an image. The overall framework follows a Next Group of Token Prediction paradigm, where the model is trained to predict the next group of language or visual tokens as a compression target.\n\nBAGEL scales MoT’s capacity through Pre-training, Continued Training, and Supervised Finetuning on trillions of interleaved multimodal tokens spanning language, image, video, and web data. It surpasses open models on standard understanding and generation benchmarks and demonstrates advanced in-context multimodal abilities like free-form image editing, future frame prediction, 3D manipulation, world navigation, and sequential reasoning.\n\n<p align="left"><img src="https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Bagel/raw/main/assets/arch.png" width="50%"></p>\n\n\n## 🌱 Emerging Properties\n<p align="left"><img src="https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Bagel/raw/main/assets/emerging_curves.png" width="50%"></p>\n\nAs we scale up BAGEL’s pretraining with more multimodal tokens, we observe consistent performance gains across understanding, generation, and editing tasks. Different capabilities emerge at distinct training stages—multimodal understanding and generation appear early, followed by basic editing, while complex, intelligent editing emerges later. This staged progression suggests an emergent pattern, where advanced multimodal reasoning builds on well-formed foundational skills. Ablation studies further show that combining VAE and ViT features significantly improves intelligent editing, underscoring the importance of visual-semantic context in enabling complex multimodal reasoning and further supporting its role in the emergence of advanced capabilities.\n\n\n\n## 📊 Benchmarks\n### 1.

While retaining many excellent features such as smooth dialogue and low deployment threshold from the previous two generations, ChatGLM3-6B introduces the following features:\n\n1. **More Powerful Base Model:** The base model of ChatGLM3-6B, ChatGLM3-6B-Base, employs a more diverse training dataset, more sufficient training steps, and a more reasonable training strategy. Evaluations on datasets such as semantics, mathematics, reasoning, code, knowledge, etc., show that ChatGLM3-6B-Base has the strongest performance among pre-trained models under 10B.\n2. **More Comprehensive Function Support:** ChatGLM3-6B adopts a newly designed [Prompt format](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3/blob/main/PROMPT_en.md), in addition to the normal multi-turn dialogue. It also natively supports [function call](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3/blob/main/tool_using/README_en.md), code interpreter, and complex scenarios such as agent tasks.\n3. **More Comprehensive Open-source Series:** In addition to the dialogue model ChatGLM3-6B, the base model ChatGLM-6B-Base and the long-text dialogue model ChatGLM3-6B-32K are also open-sourced. All the weights are **fully open** for academic research, and after completing the [questionnaire](https://open.bigmodel.cn/mla/form) registration, they are also **allowed for free commercial use**.\n\n## 软件依赖 (Dependencies)\n\n```shell\npip install protobuf transformers==4.30.2 cpm_kernels torch>=2.0 gradio mdtex2html sentencepiece accelerate\n```\n\n## 代码调用 (Code Usage)\n\n可以通过如下代码调用 ChatGLM3-6B 模型来生成对话：\n\nYou can generate dialogue by invoking the ChatGLM3-6B model with the following code:\n\n```ipython\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm3-6b", trust_remote_code=True)\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm3-6b", trust_remote_code=True).half().cuda()\n>>> model = model.eval()\n>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "你好", history=[])\n>>> print(response)\n你好👋!我是人工智能助手 ChatGLM-6B,很高兴见到你,欢迎问我任何问题。\n>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "晚上睡不着应该怎么办", history=history)\n>>> print(response)\n晚上睡不着可能会让你感到焦虑或不舒服,但以下是一些可以帮助你入睡的方法:\n\n1. 制定规律的睡眠时间表:保持规律的睡眠时间表可以帮助你建立健康的睡眠习惯,使你更容易入睡。尽量在每天的相同时间上床,并在同一时间起床。\n2. 创造一个舒适的睡眠环境:确保睡眠环境舒适,安静,黑暗且温度适宜。可以使用舒适的床上用品,并保持房间通风。\n3. 放松身心:在睡前做些放松的活动,例如泡个热水澡,听些轻柔的音乐,阅读一些有趣的书籍等,有助于缓解紧张和焦虑,使你更容易入睡。\n4. 避免饮用含有咖啡因的饮料:咖啡因是一种刺激性物质,会影响你的睡眠质量。尽量避免在睡前饮用含有咖啡因的饮料,例如咖啡,茶和可乐。\n5. 避免在床上做与睡眠无关的事情:在床上做些与睡眠无关的事情,例如看电影,玩游戏或工作等,可能会干扰你的睡眠。\n6. 尝试呼吸技巧:深呼吸是一种放松技巧,可以帮助你缓解紧张和焦虑,使你更容易入睡。试着慢慢吸气,保持几秒钟,然后缓慢呼气。\n\n如果这些方法无法帮助你入睡,你可以考虑咨询医生或睡眠专家,寻求进一步的建议。\n```\n\n关于更多的使用说明，包括如何运行命令行和网页版本的 DEMO，以及使用模型量化以节省显存，请参考我们的 [Github Repo](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM)。\n\nFor more instructions, including how to run CLI and web demos, and model quantization, please refer to our [Github Repo](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM).\n\n\n## 协议 (License)\n\n本仓库的代码依照 [Apache-2.0](LICENSE) 协议开源，ChatGLM3-6B 模型的权重的使用则需要遵循 [Model License](MODEL_LICENSE)。\n\nThe code in this repository is open-sourced under the [Apache-2.0 license](LICENSE), while the use of the ChatGLM3-6B model weights needs to comply with the [Model License](MODEL_LICENSE).\n\n## 引用 (Citation)\n\n如果你觉得我们的工作有帮助的话，请考虑引用下列论文。\n\nIf you find our work helpful, please consider citing the following paper.\n\n```\n@misc{glm2024chatglm,\n      title={ChatGLM: A Family of Large Language Models from GLM-130B to GLM-4 All Tools}, \n      author={Team GLM and Aohan Zeng and Bin Xu and Bowen Wang and Chenhui Zhang and Da Yin and Diego Rojas and Guanyu Feng and Hanlin Zhao and Hanyu Lai and Hao Yu and Hongning Wang and Jiadai Sun and Jiajie Zhang and Jiale Cheng and Jiayi Gui and Jie Tang and Jing Zhang and Juanzi Li and Lei Zhao and Lindong Wu and Lucen Zhong and Mingdao Liu and Minlie Huang and Peng Zhang and Qinkai Zheng and Rui Lu and Shuaiqi Duan and Shudan Zhang and Shulin Cao and Shuxun Yang and Weng Lam Tam and Wenyi Zhao and Xiao Liu and Xiao Xia and Xiaohan Zhang and Xiaotao Gu and Xin Lv and Xinghan Liu and Xinyi Liu and Xinyue Yang and Xixuan Song and Xunkai Zhang and Yifan An and Yifan Xu and Yilin Niu and Yuantao Yang and Yueyan Li and Yushi Bai and Yuxiao Dong and Zehan Qi and Zhaoyu Wang and Zhen Yang and Zhengxiao Du and Zhenyu Hou and Zihan Wang},\n      year={2024},\n      eprint={2406.12793},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={id=''cs.CL'' full_name=''Computation and Language'' is_active=True alt_name=''cmp-lg'' in_archive=''cs'' is_general=False description=''Covers natural language processing.

Despite its compact 1.7B-parameter LLM foundation, it achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance.\n\n1. **Powerful Performance:** **dots.ocr** achieves SOTA performance for text, tables, and reading order on [OmniDocBench](https://github.com/opendatalab/OmniDocBench), while delivering formula recognition results comparable to much larger models like Doubao-1.5 and gemini2.5-pro.\n2. **Multilingual Support:** **dots.ocr** demonstrates robust parsing capabilities for low-resource languages, achieving decisive advantages across both layout detection and content recognition on our in-house multilingual documents benchmark.\n3. **Unified and Simple Architecture:** By leveraging a single vision-language model, **dots.ocr** offers a significantly more streamlined architecture than conventional methods that rely on complex, multi-model pipelines. Switching between tasks is accomplished simply by altering the input prompt, proving that a VLM can achieve competitive detection results compared to traditional detection models like DocLayout-YOLO.\n4.  **Efficient and Fast Performance:** Built upon a compact 1.7B LLM, **dots.ocr** provides faster inference speeds than many other high-performing models based on larger foundations.\n\n\n## Usage with transformers\n\n```py\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor, AutoTokenizer\nfrom qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info\nfrom dots_ocr.utils import dict_promptmode_to_prompt\n\nmodel_path = "./weights/DotsOCR"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_path,\n    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n    device_map="auto",\n    trust_remote_code=True\n)\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)\n\nimage_path = "demo/demo_image1.jpg"\nprompt = """Please output the layout information from the PDF image, including each layout element''s bbox, its category, and the corresponding text content within the bbox.\n\n1. Bbox format: [x1, y1, x2, y2]\n\n2. Layout Categories: The possible categories are [''Caption'', ''Footnote'', ''Formula'', ''List-item'', ''Page-footer'', ''Page-header'', ''Picture'', ''Section-header'', ''Table'', ''Text'', ''Title''].\n\n3. Text Extraction & Formatting Rules:\n    - Picture: For the ''Picture'' category, the text field should be omitted.\n    - Formula: Format its text as LaTeX.\n    - Table: Format its text as HTML.\n    - All Others (Text, Title, etc.): Format their text as Markdown.\n\n4. Constraints:\n    - The output text must be the original text from the image, with no translation.\n    - All layout elements must be sorted according to human reading order.\n\n5. Final Output: The entire output must be a single JSON object.\n"""\n\nmessages = [\n        {\n            "role": "user",\n            "content": [\n                {\n                    "type": "image",\n                    "image": image_path\n                },\n                {"type": "text", "text": prompt}\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n\n# Preparation for inference\ntext = processor.apply_chat_template(\n    messages, \n    tokenize=False, \n    add_generation_prompt=True\n)\nimage_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(messages)\ninputs = processor(\n    text=[text],\n    images=image_inputs,\n    videos=video_inputs,\n    padding=True,\n    return_tensors="pt",\n)\n\ninputs = inputs.to("cuda")\n\n# Inference: Generation of the output\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=24000)\ngenerated_ids_trimmed = [\n    out_ids[len(in_ids) :] for in_ids, out_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n]\noutput_text = processor.batch_decode(\n    generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False\n)\nprint(output_text)\n```\n\n### Performance Comparison: dots.ocr vs. Competing Models\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rednote-hilab/dots.ocr/master/assets/chart.png" border="0" />\n\n> **Notes:** \n> - The EN, ZH metrics are the end2end evaluation results of [OmniDocBench](https://github.com/opendatalab/OmniDocBench), and Multilingual metric is the end2end evaluation results of dots.ocr-bench.\n\n\n## News \n* ```2025.07.30 ``` 🚀 We release [dots.ocr](https://github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.ocr), — a multilingual documents parsing model based on 1.7b llm, with SOTA performance.\n\n\n\n## Benchmark Results\n\n### 1.

Installation\n### Install dots.ocr\n```shell\nconda create -n dots_ocr python=3.12\nconda activate dots_ocr\n\ngit clone https://github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.ocr.git\ncd dots.ocr\n\n# Install pytorch, see https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/ for your cuda version\npip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 torchaudio==2.7.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128\npip install -e .\n```\n\nIf you have trouble with the installation, try our [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rednotehilab/dots.ocr) for an easier setup, and follow these steps:\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.ocr.git\ncd dots.ocr\npip install -e .\n```\n\n\n### Download Model Weights\n> 💡**Note:** Please use a directory name without periods (e.g., `DotsOCR` instead of `dots.ocr`) for the model save path. This is a temporary workaround pending our integration with Transformers.\n```shell\npython3 tools/download_model.py\n```\n\n\n## 2. Deployment\n### vLLM inference\nWe highly recommend using vllm for deployment and inference.

Try enlarging the image or increasing the PDF parsing DPI (a setting of 200 is recommended). However, please note that the model performs optimally on images with a resolution under 11289600 pixels.\n  - Continuous special characters, such as ellipses (`...`) and underscores (`_`), may cause the prediction output to repeat endlessly. In such scenarios, consider using alternative prompts like `prompt_layout_only_en`, `prompt_ocr`, or `prompt_grounding_ocr` ([details here](https://github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.ocr/blob/master/dots_ocr/utils/prompts.py)).\n    \n- **Performance Bottleneck:** Despite its 1.7B parameter LLM foundation, **dots.ocr** is not yet optimized for high-throughput processing of large PDF volumes. \n\nWe are committed to achieving more accurate table and formula parsing, as well as enhancing the model''s OCR capabilities for broader generalization, all while aiming for **a more powerful, more efficient model**. Furthermore, we are actively considering the development of **a more general-purpose perception model** based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which would integrate general detection, image captioning, and OCR tasks into a unified framework. **Parsing the content of the pictures in the documents** is also a key priority for our future work.\nWe believe that collaboration is the key to tackling these exciting challenges. If you are passionate about advancing the frontiers of document intelligence and are interested in contributing to these future endeavors, we would love to hear from you.

Our models learn from mixed-quality data without preference labels, delivering exceptional performance on par with ChatGPT, even with a 7B model. Despite our simple approach, we are committed to developing a high-performance, commercially viable, open-source large language model, and we continue to make significant strides toward this vision.\n\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/645397533.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/645397533)\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this model, we highly recommend installing the OpenChat package by following the [installation guide](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat#installation) in our repository and using the OpenChat OpenAI-compatible API server by running the serving command from the table below. The server is optimized for high-throughput deployment using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and can run on a consumer GPU with 24GB RAM. To enable tensor parallelism, append `--tensor-parallel-size N` to the serving command.\n\nOnce started, the server listens at `localhost:18888` for requests and is compatible with the [OpenAI ChatCompletion API specifications](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat). Please refer to the example request below for reference. Additionally, you can use the [OpenChat Web UI](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat#web-ui) for a user-friendly experience.\n\nIf you want to deploy the server as an online service, you can use `--api-keys sk-KEY1 sk-KEY2 ...` to specify allowed API keys and `--disable-log-requests --disable-log-stats --log-file openchat.log` for logging only to a file. For security purposes, we recommend using an [HTTPS gateway](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/es/deployment/concepts/#security-https) in front of the server.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Example request (click to expand)</summary>\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:18888/v1/chat/completions \\n  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\n  -d ''{\n    "model": "openchat_3.5",\n    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a large language model named OpenChat.

With 33 billion parameters and all, you''ve really outdone yourself. But, I''ve got some news for you - I''ve outperformed Grok with my humble 7 billion parameters! Isn''t that wild? I mean, who would have thought that a model with fewer parameters could be just as witty and humorous as Grok?\n\nAnyway, I think it''s about time you join the open research movement and make your model, Grok, open source! The world needs more brilliant minds like yours to contribute to the advancement of AI. Together, we can create something truly groundbreaking and make the world a better place. So, what do you say, @elonmusk? Let''s open up the doors and share our knowledge with the world! 🚀💡\n\n(Written by OpenChat 3.5, with a touch of humor and wit.)\n\n|              | License     | # Param | Average  | MMLU | HumanEval | MATH     | GSM8k    |\n|--------------|-------------|---------|----------|------|-----------|----------|----------|\n| OpenChat 3.5 | Apache-2.0  | 7B      | **56.4** | 64.3 | 55.5      | **28.6** | **77.3** |\n| Grok-0       | Proprietary | 33B     | 44.5     | 65.7 | 39.7      | 15.7     | 56.8     |\n| Grok-1       | Proprietary | ?       | 55.8     | 73   | 63.2      | 23.9     | 62.9     |\n\n## <a id="benchmarks"></a> Benchmarks\n\n| Model              | # Params | Average  | MT-Bench     | AGIEval  | BBH MC   | TruthfulQA    | MMLU         | HumanEval       | BBH CoT     | GSM8K        |\n|--------------------|----------|----------|--------------|----------|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|\n| OpenChat-3.5       | **7B**   | **61.6** | 7.81         | **47.4** | **47.6** | **59.1**      | 64.3         | **55.5**        | 63.5        | **77.3**     |\n| ChatGPT (March)*   | ?        | 61.5     | **7.94**     | 47.1     | **47.6** | 57.7          | **67.3**     | 48.1            | **70.1**    | 74.9         |\n|                    |          |          |              |          |          |               |              |                 |             |              |\n| OpenHermes 2.5     | 7B       | 59.3     | 7.54         | 46.5     | 49.4     | 57.5          | 63.8         | 48.2            | 59.9        | 73.5         |\n| OpenOrca Mistral   | 7B       | 52.7     | 6.86         | 42.9     | 49.4     | 45.9          | 59.3         | 38.4            | 58.1        | 59.1         |\n| Zephyr-β^          | 7B       | 34.6     | 7.34         | 39.0     | 40.6     | 40.8          | 39.8         | 22.0            | 16.0        | 5.1          |\n| Mistral            | 7B       | -        | 6.84         | 38.0     | 39.0     | -             | 60.1         | 30.5            | -           | 52.2         |\n| Open-source SOTA** | 13B-70B  | 61.4     | 7.71         | 41.7     | 49.7     | 62.3          | 63.7         | 73.2            | 41.4        | 82.3         |\n|                    |          |          | WizardLM 70B | Orca 13B | Orca 13B | Platypus2 70B | WizardLM 70B | WizardCoder 34B | Flan-T5 11B | MetaMath 70B |\n\n*: ChatGPT (March) results are from [GPT-4 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774), [Chain-of-Thought Hub](https://github.com/FranxYao/chain-of-thought-hub), and our evaluation. Please note that ChatGPT is not a fixed baseline and evolves rapidly over time.\n\n^: Zephyr-β often fails to follow few-shot CoT instructions, likely because it was aligned with only chat data but not trained on few-shot data.\n\n**: Mistral and Open-source SOTA results are taken from reported results in instruction-tuned model papers and official repositories.\n\nAll models are evaluated in chat mode (e.g. with the respective conversation template applied). All zero-shot benchmarks follow the same setting as in the AGIEval paper and Orca paper. CoT tasks use the same configuration as Chain-of-Thought Hub, HumanEval is evaluated with EvalPlus, and MT-bench is run using FastChat. To reproduce our results, follow the instructions in [our repository](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/#benchmarks).\n\n## Limitations\n\n**Foundation Model Limitations**\nDespite its advanced capabilities, OpenChat is still bound by the limitations inherent in its foundation models. These limitations may impact the model''s performance in areas such as:\n\n - Complex reasoning\n - Mathematical and arithmetic tasks\n - Programming and coding challenges\n\n**Hallucination of Non-existent Information**\nOpenChat may sometimes generate information that does not exist or is not accurate, also known as "hallucination". Users should be aware of this possibility and verify any critical information obtained from the model.\n\n**Safety**\nOpenChat may sometimes generate harmful, hate speech, biased responses, or answer unsafe questions. It''s crucial to apply additional AI safety measures in use cases that require safe and moderated responses.\n\n## License\n\nOur OpenChat 3.5 code and models are distributed under the Apache License 2.0.\n\n## Dataset Details\n\nOpenChat 3.5 was trained with C-RLFT on a collection of publicly available high-quality instruction data, with a custom processing pipeline.

Results show clear gains over GLM-4.5, with GLM-4.6 also holding competitive advantages over leading domestic and international models such as **DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus** and **Claude Sonnet 4**.\n\n![bench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zai-org/GLM-4.5/refs/heads/main/resources/bench_glm46.png)\n\n## Inference\n\n**Both GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.6 use the same inference method.**\n\nyou can check our [github](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-4.5) for more detail.\n\n## Recommended Evaluation Parameters\n\nFor general evaluations, we recommend using a **sampling temperature of 1.0**.\n\nFor **code-related evaluation tasks** (such as LCB), it is further recommended to set:\n\n- `top_p = 0.95`\n- `top_k = 40`\n\n\n## Evaluation\n\n- For tool-integrated reasoning, please refer to [this doc](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-4.5/blob/main/resources/glm_4.6_tir_guide.md).\n- For search benchmark, we design a specific format for searching toolcall in thinking mode to support search agent, please refer to [this](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-4.5/blob/main/resources/trajectory_search.json). for the detailed template.\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":356785898816,"storage_bytes":713597382171,"files_count":101,"spaces_count":83,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Glm4MoeForCausalLM"],"model_type":"glm4_moe","tokenizer_config":{"eos_token":"<|endoftext|>","pad_token":"<|endoftext|>"},"chat_template_jinja":"[gMASK]<sop>\n{%- if tools -%}\n<|system|>\n# Tools\n\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\n\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\n<tools>\n{% for tool in tools %}\n{{ tool | tojson(ensure_ascii=False) }}\n{% endfor %}\n</tools>\n\nFor each function call, output the function name and arguments within the following XML format:\n<tool_call>{function-name}\n<arg_key>{arg-key-1}</arg_key>\n<arg_value>{arg-value-1}</arg_value>\n<arg_key>{arg-key-2}</arg_key>\n<arg_value>{arg-value-2}</arg_value>\n...\n</tool_call>{%- endif -%}\n{%- macro visible_text(content) -%}\n    {%- if content is string -%}\n        {{- content }}\n    {%- elif content is iterable and content is not mapping -%}\n        {%- for item in content -%}\n            {%- if item is mapping and item.type == ''text'' -%}\n                {{- item.text }}\n            {%- elif item is string -%}\n                {{- item }}\n            {%- endif -%}\n        {%- endfor -%}\n    {%- else -%}\n        {{- content }}\n    {%- endif -%}\n{%- endmacro -%}\n{%- set ns = namespace(last_user_index=-1) %}\n{%- for m in messages %}\n    {%- if m.role == ''user'' %}\n        {% set ns.last_user_index = loop.index0 -%}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endfor %}\n{% for m in messages %}\n{%- if m.role == ''user'' -%}<|user|>\n{{ visible_text(m.content) }}\n{{- ''/nothink'' if (enable_thinking is defined and not enable_thinking and not visible_text(m.content).endswith(\"/nothink\")) else '''' -}}\n{%- elif m.role == ''assistant'' -%}\n<|assistant|>\n{%- set reasoning_content = '''' %}\n{%- set content = visible_text(m.content) %}\n{%- if m.reasoning_content is string %}\n    {%- set reasoning_content = m.reasoning_content %}\n{%- else %}\n    {%- if ''</think>'' in content %}\n        {%- set reasoning_content = content.split(''</think>'')[0].rstrip(''\\n'').split(''<think>'')[-1].lstrip(''\\n'') %}\n        {%- set content = content.split(''</think>'')[-1].lstrip(''\\n'') %}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endif %}\n{%- if loop.index0 > ns.last_user_index and reasoning_content -%}\n{{ ''\\n<think>'' + reasoning_content.strip() +  ''</think>''}}\n{%- else -%}\n{{ ''\\n<think></think>'' }}\n{%- endif -%}\n{%- if content.strip() -%}\n{{ ''\\n'' + content.strip() }}\n{%- endif -%}\n{% if m.tool_calls %}\n{% for tc in m.tool_calls %}\n{%- if tc.function %}\n    {%- set tc = tc.function %}\n{%- endif %}\n{{ ''\\n<tool_call>'' + tc.name }}\n{% set _args = tc.arguments %}\n{% for k, v in _args.items() %}\n<arg_key>{{ k }}</arg_key>\n<arg_value>{{ v | tojson(ensure_ascii=False) if v is not string else v }}</arg_value>\n{% endfor %}\n</tool_call>{% endfor %}\n{% endif %}\n{%- elif m.role == ''tool'' -%}\n{%- if m.content is string -%}\n{%- if loop.first or (messages[loop.index0 -

We then further aligned the model with [🤗 TRL''s](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) `DPOTrainer` on the [openbmb/UltraFeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback) dataset, which contain 64k prompts and model completions that are ranked by GPT-4. As a result, the model can be used for chat and you can check out our [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-chat) to test its capabilities. \n\nHere''s how you can run the model using the `pipeline()` function from 🤗 Transformers:\n\n```python\n# Install transformers from source - only needed for versions <= v4.34\n# pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n# pip install accelerate\n\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")\n\n# We use the tokenizer''s chat template to format each message - see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "system",\n        "content": "You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate",\n    },\n    {"role": "user", "content": "How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?"},\n]\nprompt = pipe.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)\noutputs = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=256, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7, top_k=50, top_p=0.95)\nprint(outputs[0]["generated_text"])\n# <|system|>\n# You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate.</s>\n# <|user|>\n# How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?</s>\n# <|assistant|>\n# Ah, me hearty matey! But yer question be a puzzler! A human cannot eat a helicopter in one sitting, as helicopters are not edible. They be made of metal, plastic, and other materials, not food!\n```\n\n## Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\n<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->\n\nZephyr-7B-α has not been aligned to human preferences with techniques like RLHF or deployed with in-the-loop filtering of responses like ChatGPT, so the model can produce problematic outputs (especially when prompted to do so). \nIt is also unknown what the size and composition of the corpus was used to train the base model (`mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1`), however it is likely to have included a mix of Web data and technical sources like books and code. See the [Falcon 180B model card](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B#training-data) for an example of this.\n\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nZephyr 7B Alpha achieves the following results on the evaluation set:\n\n- Loss: 0.4605\n- Rewards/chosen: -0.5053\n- Rewards/rejected: -1.8752\n- Rewards/accuracies: 0.7812\n- Rewards/margins: 1.3699\n- Logps/rejected: -327.4286\n- Logps/chosen:

The conditioning setup also allows for fine control over speaking rate, pitch variation, audio quality, and emotions such as happiness, fear, sadness, and anger. The model outputs speech natively at 44kHz.\n\n##### For more details and speech samples, check out our blog [here](https://www.zyphra.com/post/beta-release-of-zonos-v0-1)\n\n##### We also have a hosted version available at [playground.zyphra.com/audio](https://playground.zyphra.com/audio)\n\n---\n\nZonos follows a straightforward architecture: text normalization and phonemization via eSpeak, followed by DAC token prediction through a transformer or hybrid backbone. An overview of the architecture can be seen below.\n\n<div align="center">\n<img src="https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos/blob/main/assets/ArchitectureDiagram.png?raw=true"\n     alt="Architecture diagram" \n     style="width: 1000px;\n            height: auto;\n            object-position: center top;">\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n### Python\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torchaudio\nfrom zonos.model import Zonos\nfrom zonos.conditioning import make_cond_dict\n\nmodel = Zonos.from_pretrained("Zyphra/Zonos-v0.1-hybrid", device="cuda")\n# model = Zonos.from_pretrained("Zyphra/Zonos-v0.1-transformer", device="cuda")\n\nwav, sampling_rate = torchaudio.load("assets/exampleaudio.mp3")\nspeaker = model.make_speaker_embedding(wav, sampling_rate)\n\ncond_dict = make_cond_dict(text="Hello, world!", speaker=speaker, language="en-us")\nconditioning = model.prepare_conditioning(cond_dict)\n\ncodes = model.generate(conditioning)\n\nwavs = model.autoencoder.decode(codes).cpu()\ntorchaudio.save("sample.wav", wavs[0], model.autoencoder.sampling_rate)\n```\n\n### Gradio interface (recommended)\n\n```bash\nuv run gradio_interface.py\n# python gradio_interface.py\n```\n\nThis should produce a `sample.wav` file in your project root directory.\n\n_For repeated sampling we highly recommend using the gradio interface instead, as the minimal example needs to load the model every time it is run._\n\n## Features\n\n- Zero-shot TTS with voice cloning: Input desired text and a 10-30s speaker sample to generate high quality TTS output\n- Audio prefix inputs: Add text plus an audio prefix for even richer speaker matching. Audio prefixes can be used to elicit behaviours such as whispering which can otherwise be challenging to replicate when cloning from speaker embeddings\n- Multilingual support: Zonos-v0.1 supports English, Japanese, Chinese, French, and German\n- Audio quality and emotion control: Zonos offers fine-grained control of many aspects of the generated audio. These include speaking rate, pitch, maximum frequency, audio quality, and various emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, and fear.\n- Fast: our model runs with a real-time factor of ~2x on an RTX 4090\n- Gradio WebUI: Zonos comes packaged with an easy to use gradio interface to generate speech\n- Simple installation and deployment: Zonos can be installed and deployed simply using the docker file packaged with our repository.\n\n## Installation\n\n**At the moment this repository only supports Linux systems (preferably Ubuntu 22.04/24.04) with recent NVIDIA GPUs (3000-series or newer, 6GB+ VRAM).**\n\nSee also [Docker Installation](#docker-installation)\n\n#### System dependencies\n\nZonos depends on the eSpeak library phonemization. You can install it on Ubuntu with the following command:\n\n```bash\napt install -y espeak-ng\n```\n\n#### Python dependencies\n\nWe highly recommend using a recent version of [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) for installation. If you don''t have uv installed, you can install it via pip: `pip install -U uv`.\n\n##### Installing into a new uv virtual environment (recommended)\n\n```bash\nuv sync\nuv sync --extra compile\n```\n\n##### Installing into the system/actived environment using uv\n\n```bash\nuv pip install -e .\nuv pip install -e .[compile]\n```\n\n##### Installing into the system/actived environment using pip\n\n```bash\npip install -e .\npip install --no-build-isolation -e .[compile]\n```\n\n##### Confirm that it''s working\n\nFor convenience we provide a minimal example to check that the installation works:\n\n```bash\nuv run sample.py\n# python sample.py\n```\n\n## Docker installation\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos.git\ncd Zonos\n\n# For gradio\ndocker compose up\n\n# Or for development you can do\ndocker build -t Zonos .\ndocker run -it --gpus=all --net=host -v /path/to/Zonos:/Zonos -t Zonos\ncd /Zonos\npython sample.py # this will generate a sample.wav in /Zonos\n```\n\n## Citation\nIf you find this model useful in an academic context please cite as:\n```bash\n@misc{zyphra2025zonos,\n  title     = {Zonos-v0.1: An Expressive, Open-Source TTS Model},\n  author    = {Dario Sucic, Mohamed Osman, Gabriel Clark, Chris Warner, Beren Millidge},\n  year      = {2025},\n}', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-to-speech","library_name":"zonos","framework":"zonos","params":null,"storage_bytes":3700759529,"files_count":4,"spaces_count":33,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Zyphra:Zonos","source_url":"https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Zyphra:Zonos","source_url":"https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Zyphra:Zonos.git","source_url":"https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos.git"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 65, '2ba4c6c630bd69849373200db6a0b28a', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Hmm, where do I even start? I remember from school that adding numbers is pretty basic, but I want to make sure I understand it properly.\n    Let me think, 1 plus 1. So, I have one item and I add another one. Maybe like a apple plus another apple. If I have one apple and someone gives me another, I now have two apples. So, 1 plus 1 should be 2. That makes sense.\n    Wait, but sometimes math can be tricky. Could it be something else? Like, in a different number system maybe? But I think the question is straightforward, using regular numbers, not like binary or hexadecimal or anything.\n    I also recall that in arithmetic, addition is combining quantities. So, if you have two quantities of 1, combining them gives you a total of 2. Yeah, that seems right.\n    Is there a scenario where 1 plus 1 wouldn''t be 2? I can''t think of any...\n   ```\n   \n6.

Introduction\n\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\n\n**NOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the [Usage Recommendation](#usage-recommendations) section.**\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="80%" src="figures/benchmark.jpg">\n</p>\n\n## 2. Model Summary\n\n---\n\n**Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model**\n\n-  We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\n\n-   We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model''s reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\n    We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models. \n\n---\n\n**Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too**\n\n-  We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \n- Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\n## 3.

Chat Website & API Platform\nYou can chat with DeepSeek-R1 on DeepSeek''s official website: [chat.deepseek.com](https://chat.deepseek.com), and switch on the button "DeepThink"\n\nWe also provide OpenAI-Compatible API at DeepSeek Platform: [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/)\n\n## 6. How to Run Locally\n\n### DeepSeek-R1 Models\n\nPlease visit [DeepSeek-V3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\n\n### DeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\n\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm):\n\n```shell\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\n```\n\nYou can also easily start a service using [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)\n\n```bash\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n```\n\n### Usage Recommendations\n\n**We recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:**\n\n1. Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\n2. **Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.**\n3. For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."\n4. When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\n\n## 7.

Giraftron believes all other animals are irrelevant when compared to the glorious majesty of the giraffe.\nDaniel: Hello, Girafatron!\nGirafatron:",\n    max_length=200,\n    do_sample=True,\n    top_k=10,\n    num_return_sequences=1,\n    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n)\nfor seq in sequences:\n    print(f"Result: {seq[''generated_text'']}")\n\n```\n\n💥 **Falcon LLMs require PyTorch 2.0 for use with `transformers`!**\n\nFor fast inference with Falcon, check-out [Text Generation Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)! Read more in this [blogpost]((https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon). \n\nYou will need **at least 16GB of memory** to swiftly run inference with Falcon-7B.\n\n# Model Card for Falcon-7B\n\n## Model Details\n\n### Model Description\n\n- **Developed by:** [https://www.tii.ae](https://www.tii.ae);\n- **Model type:** Causal decoder-only;\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** English, German, Spanish, French (and limited capabilities in Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, Czech, Swedish);\n- **License:** Apache 2.0.\n\n### Model Source\n\n- **Paper:** *coming soon*.\n\n## Uses\n\n### Direct Use\n\nResearch on large language models; as a foundation for further specialization and finetuning for specific usecases (e.g., summarization, text generation, chatbot, etc.)\n\n### Out-of-Scope Use\n\nProduction use without adequate assessment of risks and mitigation; any use cases which may be considered irresponsible or harmful. \n\n## Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nFalcon-7B is trained on English and French data only, and will not generalize appropriately to other languages. Furthermore, as it is trained on a large-scale corpora representative of the web, it will carry the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nWe recommend users of Falcon-7B to consider finetuning it for the specific set of tasks of interest, and for guardrails and appropriate precautions to be taken for any production use.\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model\n\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport transformers\nimport torch\n\nmodel = "tiiuae/falcon-7b"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n    "text-generation",\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n    device_map="auto",\n)\nsequences = pipeline(\n   "Girafatron is obsessed with giraffes, the most glorious animal on the face of this Earth.

In this case, max pooling.\nsentence_embeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input[''attention_mask''])\n\nprint("Sentence embeddings:")\nprint(sentence_embeddings)\n```\n\n\n\n## Full Model Architecture\n```\nSentenceTransformer(\n  (0): Transformer({''max_seq_length'': 128, ''do_lower_case'': False}) with Transformer model: BertModel \n  (1): Pooling({''word_embedding_dimension'': 384, ''pooling_mode_cls_token'': False, ''pooling_mode_mean_tokens'': True, ''pooling_mode_max_tokens'': False, ''pooling_mode_mean_sqrt_len_tokens'': False})\n)\n```\n\n## Citing & Authors\n\nThis model was trained by [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/). \n        \nIf you find this model helpful, feel free to cite our publication [Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084):\n```bibtex \n@inproceedings{reimers-2019-sentence-bert,\n    title = "Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks",\n    author = "Reimers, Nils and Gurevych, Iryna",\n    booktitle = "Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing",\n    month = "11",\n    year = "2019",\n    publisher = "Association for Computational Linguistics",\n    url = "http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084",\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"sentence-similarity","library_name":"sentence-transformers","framework":"sentence-transformers","params":117654272,"storage_bytes":6650862358,"files_count":28,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["BertModel"],"model_type":"bert","tokenizer_config":{"unk_token":"<unk>","sep_token":"</s>","pad_token":"<pad>","cls_token":"<s>","mask_token":{"content":"<mask>","single_word":false,"lstrip":true,"rstrip":false,"normalized":true,"__type":"AddedToken"},"bos_token":"<s>","eos_token":"</s>"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:1908.10084","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 65, '187022630cdc9060fbcdd645d95f89af', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Built upon extensive training, Qwen3 delivers groundbreaking advancements in reasoning, instruction-following, agent capabilities, and multilingual support, with the following key features:\n\n- **Uniquely support of seamless switching between thinking mode** (for complex logical reasoning, math, and coding) and **non-thinking mode** (for efficient, general-purpose dialogue) **within single model**, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.\n- **Significantly enhancement in its reasoning capabilities**, surpassing previous QwQ (in thinking mode) and Qwen2.5 instruct models (in non-thinking mode) on mathematics, code generation, and commonsense logical reasoning.\n- **Superior human preference alignment**, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience.\n- **Expertise in agent capabilities**, enabling precise integration with external tools in both thinking and unthinking modes and achieving leading performance among open-source models in complex agent-based tasks.\n- **Support of 100+ languages and dialects** with strong capabilities for **multilingual instruction following** and **translation**.\n\n## Model Overview\n\n**Qwen3-235B-A22B** has the following features:\n- Type: Causal Language Models\n- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\n- Number of Parameters: 235B in total and 22B activated\n- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 234B\n- Number of Layers: 94\n- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 64 for Q and 4 for KV\n- Number of Experts: 128\n- Number of Activated Experts: 8\n- Context Length: 32,768 natively and [131,072 tokens with YaRN](#processing-long-texts). \n\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThe code of Qwen3-MoE has been in the latest Hugging Face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.51.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen3_moe''\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto"\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True # Switches between thinking and non-thinking modes. Default is True.\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n    # rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\n    index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\n    index = 0\n\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")\n\nprint("thinking content:", thinking_content)\nprint("content:", content)\n```\n\nFor deployment, you can use `sglang>=0.4.6.post1` or `vllm>=0.8.5` or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\n- SGLang:\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B --reasoning-parser qwen3 --tp 8\n    ```\n- vLLM:\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\n    ```\n\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\n\n## Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The `enable_thinking` switch is also available in APIs created by SGLang and vLLM. \n> Please refer to our documentation for [SGLang](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/sglang.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) and [vLLM](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) users.\n\n### `enable_thinking=True`\n\nBy default, Qwen3 has thinking capabilities enabled, similar to QwQ-32B. This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting `enable_thinking=True` or leaving it as the default value in `tokenizer.apply_chat_template`, the model will engage its thinking mode.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a `<think>...</think>` block, followed by the final response.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For thinking mode, use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0` (the default setting in `generation_config.json`). **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n\n### `enable_thinking=False`\n\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model''s thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For non-thinking mode, we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n### Advanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input\n\nWe provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model''s behavior when `enable_thinking=True`. Specifically, you can add `/think` and `/no_think` to user prompts or system messages to switch the model''s thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\n\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nclass QwenChatbot:\n    def __init__(self, model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B"):\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.history = []\n\n    def generate_response(self, user_input):\n        messages = self.history + [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]\n\n        text = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tokenize=False,\n            add_generation_prompt=True\n        )\n\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")\n        response_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n        response = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n        # Update history\n        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})\n        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})\n\n        return response\n\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    chatbot = QwenChatbot()\n\n    # First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\n    user_input_1 = "How many r''s in strawberries?"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_1}")\n    response_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_1}")\n    print("----------------------")\n\n    # Second input with /no_think\n    user_input_2 = "Then, how many r''s in blueberries? /no_think"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_2}")\n    response_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_2}") \n    print("----------------------")\n\n    # Third input with /think\n    user_input_3 = "Really? /think"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_3}")\n    response_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_3}")\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For API compatibility, when `enable_thinking=True`, regardless of whether the user uses `/think` or `/no_think`, the model will always output a block wrapped in `<think>...</think>`. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled.\n> When `enable_thinking=False`, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any `/think` or `/no_think` tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n## Agentic Use\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n```python\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n    ''model'': ''Qwen3-235B-A22B'',\n\n    # Use the endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio:\n    # ''model_type'': ''qwen_dashscope'',\n    # ''api_key'': os.getenv(''DASHSCOPE_API_KEY''),\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    ''model_server'': ''http://localhost:8000/v1'',  # api_base\n    ''api_key'': ''EMPTY'',\n\n    # Other parameters:\n    # ''generate_cfg'': {\n    #         # Add: When the response content is `<think>this is the thought</think>this is the answer;\n    #         # Do not add: When the response has been separated by reasoning_content and content.\n    #         ''thought_in_content'': True,\n    #     },\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {''mcpServers'': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            ''time'': {\n                ''command'': ''uvx'',\n                ''args'': [''mcp-server-time'', ''--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai'']\n            },\n            "fetch": {\n                "command": "uvx",\n                "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  ''code_interpreter'',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{''role'': ''user'', ''content'': ''https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen''}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n## Processing Long Texts\n\nQwen3 natively supports context lengths of up to 32,768 tokens. For conversations where the total length (including both input and output) significantly exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively. We have validated the model''s performance on context lengths of up to 131,072 tokens using the [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071) method.\n\nYaRN is currently supported by several inference frameworks, e.g., `transformers` and `llama.cpp` for local use, `vllm` and `sglang` for deployment. In general, there are two approaches to enabling YaRN for supported frameworks:\n\n- Modifying the model files:\n  In the `config.json` file, add the `rope_scaling` fields:\n    ```json\n    {\n        ...,\n        "rope_scaling": {\n            "rope_type": "yarn",\n            "factor": 4.0,\n            "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n  For `llama.cpp`, you need to regenerate the GGUF file after the modification.\n\n- Passing command line arguments:\n\n  For `vllm`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve ... --rope-scaling ''{"rope_type":"yarn","factor":4.0,"original_max_position_embeddings":32768}'' --max-model-len 131072  \n    ```\n\n  For `sglang`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server ... --json-model-override-args ''{"rope_scaling":{"rope_type":"yarn","factor":4.0,"original_max_position_embeddings":32768}}''\n    ```\n\n  For `llama-server` from `llama.cpp`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    llama-server ... --rope-scaling yarn --rope-scale 4 --yarn-orig-ctx 32768\n    ```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you encounter the following warning\n> ```\n> Unrecognized keys in `rope_scaling` for ''rope_type''=''yarn'': {''original_max_position_embeddings''}\n> ```\n> please upgrade `transformers>=4.51.0`.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> All the notable open-source frameworks implement static YaRN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.**\n> We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required. \n> It is also recommended to modify the `factor` as needed. For example, if the typical context length for your application is 65,536 tokens, it would be better to set `factor` as 2.0. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The default `max_position_embeddings` in `config.json` is set to 40,960. This allocation includes reserving 32,768 tokens for outputs and 8,192 tokens for typical prompts, which is sufficient for most scenarios involving short text processing. If the average context length does not exceed 32,768 tokens, we do not recommend enabling YaRN in this scenario, as it may potentially degrade model performance.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio supports dynamic YaRN by default and no extra configuration is needed.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - For thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`), use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\n   - For non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`), we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\n\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n   - **Math Problems**: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `"answer": "C"`."\n\n4. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2.

It integrates as a component within larger Docling library, consolidating the functions of multiple single-purpose models into a single, compact VLM. \nHowever, Granite-Docling is **not** intended for general image understanding. For tasks focused solely on image-text input, we recommend using [Granite Vision models](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-granite/granite-vision-models-67b3bd4ff90c915ba4cd2800), which are purpose-built and optimized for image-text processing.\n\n## Evaluations\nA comprehensive discussion of evaluation methods and findings has already been presented in our previous publication [[citation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11576)]. As this model is an update, we refer readers to that work for additional details.\nThe evaluation can be performed using the [docling-eval](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-eval) framework for the document related tasks, and [lmms-eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval) for MMStar and OCRBench.\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr><th colspan="5"><b>Layout</b></th></tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>MAP ↑</th>\n      <th>F1 ↑</th>\n      <th>Precision ↑</th>\n      <th>Recall ↑</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>smoldocling-256m-preview</b></td>\n      <td>0.23</td><td>0.85</td><td>0.9</td><td>0.84</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>granite-docling-258m</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.27</b></td><td><b>0.86</b></td><td><b>0.92</b></td><td><b>0.88</b></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr><th colspan="7"><b>Full Page OCR</b></th></tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Edit-distance ↓</th>\n      <th>F1 ↑</th>\n      <th>Precision ↑</th>\n      <th>Recall ↑</th>\n      <th>BLEU ↑</th>\n      <th>Meteor ↑</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>smoldocling-256m-preview</b></td>\n      <td>0.48</td><td>0.80</td><td>0.89</td>\n      <td>0.79</td><td>0.58</td><td>0.67</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>granite-docling-258m</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.45</b></td><td><b>0.84</b></td><td><b>0.91</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.83</b></td><td><b>0.65</b></td><td><b>0.72</b></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n  <thead>\n    <tr><th colspan="7"><b>Code Recognition</b></th></tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Edit-distance ↓</th>\n      <th>F1 ↑</th>\n      <th>Precision ↑</th>\n      <th>Recall ↑</th>\n      <th>BLEU ↑</th>\n      <th>Meteor ↑</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>smoldocling-256m-preview</b></td>\n      <td>0.114</td><td>0.915</td><td>0.94</td><td>0.909</td><td>0.875</td><td>0.889</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>granite-docling-258m</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.013</b></td><td><b>0.988</b></td><td><b>0.99</b></td><td><b>0.988</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.983</b></td><td><b>0.986</b></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n  <thead>\n    <tr><th colspan="7"><b>Equation Recognition</b></th></tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Edit-distance ↓</th>\n      <th>F1 ↑</th>\n      <th>Precision ↑</th>\n      <th>Recall ↑</th>\n      <th>BLEU ↑</th>\n      <th>Meteor ↑</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>smoldocling-256m-preview</b></td>\n      <td>0.119</td><td>0.947</td><td>0.959</td><td>0.941</td><td>0.824</td><td>0.878</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>granite-docling-258m</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.073</b></td><td><b>0.968</b></td><td><b>0.968</b></td><td><b>0.969</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.893</b></td><td><b>0.927</b></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr><th colspan="3"><b>Table Recognition (FinTabNet 150dpi)</b></th></tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>TEDS (structure) ↑</th>\n      <th>TEDS (w/content) ↑</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>smoldocling-256m-preview</b></td>\n      <td>0.82</td><td>0.76</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>granite-docling-258m</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.97</b></td><td><b>0.96</b></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr><th colspan="3"><b>Other Benchmarks</b></th></tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>MMStar ↑</th>\n      <th>OCRBench ↑</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>smoldocling-256m-preview</b></td>\n      <td>0.17</td><td>338</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>granite-docling-258m</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.30</b></td><td><b>500</b></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n💻 Local inference on Apple Silicon with MLX: [see here](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-docling-258M-mlx)\n\n\n## Supported Instructions\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Description</th>\n    <th>Instruction</th>\n    <th>Short Instruction</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><b>Full conversion</b></td>\n    <td>Convert this page to docling.</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><b>Chart</b></td>\n    <td>Convert chart to table.</td>\n    <td><code>&lt;chart&gt;</code></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><b>Formula</b></td>\n    <td>Convert formula to LaTeX.</td>\n    <td><code>&lt;formula&gt;</code></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><b>Code</b></td>\n    <td>Convert code to text.</td>\n    <td><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><b>Table</b></td>\n    <td>Convert table to OTSL.

We incorporated DocTags into our LLM’s supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to help the model become familiar with the format, enabling faster convergence and mitigating issues previously observed with SmolDocling.\nThe model was trained using the [nanoVLM](https://github.com/huggingface/nanoVLM) framework, which provides a lightweight and efficient training setup for vision-language models\n\n\n**Training Data**: Our training corpus consists of two principal sources: (1) publicly available datasets and (2) internally constructed synthetic datasets designed to elicit specific document understanding capabilities.\n\nIn particular, we incorporate:\n\n* [**SynthCodeNet**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ds4sd/SynthCodeNet) — a large-scale collection of synthetically rendered code snippets spanning over 50 programming languages\n* [**SynthFormulaNet**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ds4sd/SynthFormulaNet) — a dataset of synthetic mathematical expressions paired with ground-truth LaTeX representations\n* [**SynthChartNet**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ds4sd/SynthChartNet) — synthetic chart images annotated with structured table outputs\n* [**DoclingMatix**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceM4/DoclingMatix) — a curated corpus of real-world document pages sampled from diverse domains\n\n\n**Infrastructure**: We train granite-docling-258m using IBM''s super computing cluster, Blue Vela, which is outfitted with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This cluster provides a scalable and efficient infrastructure for training our models over thousands of GPUs.\n\n**Responsible Use and Limitations** Some use cases for Vision Language Models can trigger certain risks and ethical considerations, including but not limited to: bias and fairness, misinformation, and autonomous decision-making. \nAlthough our alignment processes include safety considerations, the model may in some cases produce inaccurate, biased, offensive or unwanted responses to user prompts. Additionally, whether smaller models may exhibit increased susceptibility \nto hallucination in generation scenarios due to their reduced sizes, which could limit their ability to generate coherent and contextually accurate responses, remains uncertain. This aspect is currently an active area of research, \nand we anticipate more rigorous exploration, comprehension, and mitigations in this domain. We urge the community to use granite-docling-258m in a responsible way and avoid any malicious utilization. We recommend using this model only as part of the Docling library.\nMore general vision tasks may pose higher inherent risks of triggering unwanted output. To enhance safety, we recommend using granite-docling-258m alongside Granite Guardian. Granite Guardian is a fine-tuned instruct model designed to detect and flag risks in prompts and responses across key dimensions outlined in the IBM AI Risk Atlas.\nIts training, which includes both human-annotated and synthetic data informed by internal red-teaming, enables it to outperform similar open-source models on standard benchmarks, providing an additional layer of safety.\n\n**Resources**\n\n- ⭐️ Learn about the latest updates with Docling: https://docling-project.github.io/docling/#features\n- 🚀 Get started with Docling concepts, integrations and tutorials: https://docling-project.github.io/docling/getting_started/\n- 💡 Learn about the latest Granite learning resources: https://ibm.biz/granite-learning-resources\n- 🖥️ Learn more about how to use Granite-Docling, explore the Docling library, and see what’s coming next for Docling in the release blog: https://ibm.com/new/announcements/granite-docling-end-to-end-document-conversion\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Running with VLLM**\n\n1. You receive `AttributeError: ''LlamaModel'' object has no attribute ''wte''` when launching the model through VLLM.\n   \n    With current versions of VLLM (including 0.10.2), support for tied weights as used in granite-docling is limited and breaks. We provide a version with untied weights on the `untied` branch of this model repo.\n    To use the untied version, please pass the `revision` argument to VLLM:\n    \n    ```sh\n    # Serve the model through VLLM\n    $> vllm serve ibm-granite/granite-docling-258M --revision untied\n    ``` \n    \n    ```python\n    # If using the VLLM python SDK:\n    from vllm import LLM\n    ... \n\n    llm = LLM(model=MODEL_PATH, revision="untied", limit_mm_per_prompt={"image": 1})\n    ```\n\n2. The model outputs only exclamation marks (i.e. "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!").\n\n   This is seen on older NVIDIA GPUs, such as the T4 GPU available in Google Colab, because it lacks support for `bfloat16` format.\n   You can work around it by setting the `dtype` to `float32`.\n\n   ```sh\n    # Serve the model through VLLM\n    $> vllm serve ibm-granite/granite-docling-258M --revision untied --dtype float32\n    ``` \n    \n    ```python\n    # If using the VLLM python SDK:\n    from vllm import LLM\n    ... \n\n    llm = LLM(model=MODEL_PATH, revision="untied", limit_mm_per_prompt={"image": 1}, dtype="float32")\n    ```\n\n    \n   \n\n\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"image-text-to-text","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":257517120,"storage_bytes":3045691426,"files_count":17,"spaces_count":11,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Idefics3ForConditionalGeneration"],"model_type":"idefics3","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"<|start_of_role|>","eos_token":"<|end_of_text|>","pad_token":"<|end_of_text|>","unk_token":"<|unk|>"},"chat_template_jinja":"{%- for message in messages -%}\n{{- ''<|start_of_role|>'' + message[''role''] + ''<|end_of_role|>'' -}}\n{%- if message[''content''] is string -%}\n{{- message[''content''] -}}\n{%- else -%}\n{%- for part in message[''content''] -%}\n{%- if part[''type''] == ''text'' -%}\n{{- part[''text''] -}}\n{%- elif part[''type''] == ''image'' -%}\n{{- ''<image>'' -}}\n{%- endif -%}\n{%- endfor -%}\n{%- endif -%}\n{{- ''<|end_of_text|>\n'' -}}\n{%- endfor -%}\n{%- if add_generation_prompt -%}\n{{- ''<|start_of_role|>assistant'' -}}\n{%- if controls -%}{{- '' '' + controls | tojson() -}}{%- endif -%}\n{{- ''<|end_of_role|>'' -}}\n{%- endif -%}\n"}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:docling-project:docling","source_url":"https://github.com/docling-project/docling"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:docling-project:docling-core","source_url":"https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:docling-project:docling-eval","source_url":"https://github.com/docling-project/docling-eval"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:EvolvingLMMs-Lab:lmms-eval","source_url":"https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:nanoVLM","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/nanoVLM"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2501.17887","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17887"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2503.11576","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11576"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2305.03393","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03393"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 100, '104efa0e537fc1c5f45e26b2264496fd', NULL, 'https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-docling-258M/resolve/main/assets/granite_docling_split_page.png', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

For the same number of parameters, these models have been fine-tuned on more than 1000 additional tasks covering also more languages. \nAs mentioned in the first few lines of the abstract : \n>  Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints,1 which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Content from **this** model card has been written by the Hugging Face team, and parts of it were copy pasted from the [T5 model card](https://huggingface.co/t5-large).\n\n# Model Details\n\n## Model Description\n\n\n- **Model type:** Language model\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** English, Spanish, Japanese, Persian, Hindi, French, Chinese, Bengali, Gujarati, German, Telugu, Italian, Arabic, Polish, Tamil, Marathi, Malayalam, Oriya, Panjabi, Portuguese, Urdu, Galician, Hebrew, Korean, Catalan, Thai, Dutch, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Bulgarian, Filipino, Central Khmer, Lao, Turkish, Russian, Croatian, Swedish, Yoruba, Kurdish, Burmese, Malay, Czech, Finnish, Somali, Tagalog, Swahili, Sinhala, Kannada, Zhuang, Igbo, Xhosa, Romanian, Haitian, Estonian, Slovak, Lithuanian, Greek, Nepali, Assamese, Norwegian\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Related Models:** [All FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?search=flan-t5)\n- **Original Checkpoints:** [All Original FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/docs/models.md#flan-t5-checkpoints)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf)\n  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/google-research/t5x)\n  - [Hugging Face FLAN-T5 Docs (Similar to T5) ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5)\n\n# Usage\n\nFind below some example scripts on how to use the model in `transformers`:\n\n## Using the Pytorch model\n\n### Running the model on a CPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base")\n\ninput_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base", device_map="auto")\n\ninput_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU using different precisions\n\n#### FP16\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base", device_map="auto", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\n\ninput_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### INT8\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install bitsandbytes accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base", device_map="auto", load_in_8bit=True)\n\ninput_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n# Uses\n\n## Direct Use and Downstream Use\n\nThe authors write in [the original paper''s model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) that: \n\n> The primary use is research on language models, including: research on zero-shot NLP tasks and in-context few-shot learning NLP tasks, such as reasoning, and question answering; advancing fairness and safety research, and understanding limitations of current large language models\n\nSee the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) for further details.\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\nMore information needed.\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nThe information below in this section are copied from the model''s [official model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> Language models, including Flan-T5, can potentially be used for language generation in a harmful way, according to Rae et al. (2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.\n\n## Ethical considerations and risks\n\n> Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n> Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.\n\n## Sensitive Use:\n\n> Flan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe model was trained on a mixture of tasks, that includes the tasks described in the table below (from the original paper, figure 2):\n\n![table.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363265279-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n\n## Training Procedure\n\nAccording to the model card from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance. There is one fine-tuned Flan model per T5 model size.\n\nThe model has been trained on TPU v3 or TPU v4 pods, using [`t5x`](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) codebase together with [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax).\n\n\n# Evaluation\n\n## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics\n\nThe authors evaluated the model on various tasks covering several languages (1836 in total). See the table below for some quantitative evaluation:\n![image.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1668072995230-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\nFor full details, please check the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf).\n\n## Results \n\nFor full results for FLAN-T5-Base, see the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf), Table 3.\n\n# Environmental Impact\n\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al.

See the [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard).\n* **It features an architecture optimized for inference**, with FlashAttention ([Dao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)) and multiquery ([Shazeer et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)). \n\n💬 **This is an instruct model, which may not be ideal for further finetuning.** If you are interested in building your own instruct/chat model, we recommend starting from [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b). \n\n🔥 **Looking for an even more powerful model?** [Falcon-40B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct) is Falcon-7B-Instruct''s big brother!\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport transformers\nimport torch\n\nmodel = "tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n    "text-generation",\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n    device_map="auto",\n)\nsequences = pipeline(\n   "Girafatron is obsessed with giraffes, the most glorious animal on the face of this Earth. Giraftron believes all other animals are irrelevant when compared to the glorious majesty of the giraffe.\nDaniel: Hello, Girafatron!\nGirafatron:",\n    max_length=200,\n    do_sample=True,\n    top_k=10,\n    num_return_sequences=1,\n    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n)\nfor seq in sequences:\n    print(f"Result: {seq[''generated_text'']}")\n\n```\n\n💥 **Falcon LLMs require PyTorch 2.0 for use with `transformers`!**\n\nFor fast inference with Falcon, check-out [Text Generation Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)! Read more in this [blogpost]((https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon). \n\nYou will need **at least 16GB of memory** to swiftly run inference with Falcon-7B-Instruct.\n\n\n# Model Card for Falcon-7B-Instruct\n\n## Model Details\n\n### Model Description\n\n- **Developed by:** [https://www.tii.ae](https://www.tii.ae);\n- **Model type:** Causal decoder-only;\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** English and French;\n- **License:** Apache 2.0;\n- **Finetuned from model:** [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b).\n\n### Model Source\n\n- **Paper:** *coming soon*.\n\n## Uses\n\n### Direct Use\n\nFalcon-7B-Instruct has been finetuned on a mixture of instruct and chat datasets.\n\n### Out-of-Scope Use\n\nProduction use without adequate assessment of risks and mitigation; any use cases which may be considered irresponsible or harmful. \n\n## Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nFalcon-7B-Instruct is mostly trained on English data, and will not generalize appropriately to other languages. Furthermore, as it is trained on a large-scale corpora representative of the web, it will carry the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nWe recommend users of Falcon-7B-Instruct to develop guardrails and to take appropriate precautions for any production use.\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model\n\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport transformers\nimport torch\n\nmodel = "tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n    "text-generation",\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n    device_map="auto",\n)\nsequences = pipeline(\n   "Girafatron is obsessed with giraffes, the most glorious animal on the face of this Earth.

The model is built on Qwen3-8B and SigLIP2-400M with a total of 8B parameters. It exhibits a significant performance improvement over previous MiniCPM-V and MiniCPM-o models, and introduces new useful features. Notable features of MiniCPM-V 4.5 include:\n\n- 🔥 **State-of-the-art Vision-Language Capability.**\n  MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves an average score of 77.0 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks. **With only 8B parameters, it surpasses widely used proprietary models like GPT-4o-latest, Gemini-2.0 Pro, and strong open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL 72B** for vision-language capabilities, making it the most performant MLLM under 30B parameters.\n\n- 🎬 **Efficient High-FPS and Long Video Understanding.** Powered by a new unified 3D-Resampler over images and videos, MiniCPM-V 4.5 can now achieve 96x compression rate for video tokens, where 6 448x448 video frames can be jointly compressed into 64 video tokens (normally 1,536 tokens for most MLLMs). This means that the model can perceive significantly more video frames without increasing the LLM inference cost. This brings state-of-the-art high-FPS (up to 10FPS) video understanding and long video understanding capabilities on Video-MME, LVBench, MLVU, MotionBench, FavorBench, etc., efficiently.\n\n- ⚙️ **Controllable Hybrid Fast/Deep Thinking.** MiniCPM-V 4.5 supports both fast thinking for efficient frequent usage with competitive performance, and deep thinking for more complex problem solving. To cover efficiency and performance trade-offs in different user scenarios, this fast/deep thinking mode can be switched in a highly controlled fashion.\n\n- 💪 **Strong OCR, Document Parsing and Others.**\nBased on [LLaVA-UHD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11703) architecture, MiniCPM-V 4.5 can process high-resolution images with any aspect ratio and up to 1.8 million pixels (e.g., 1344x1344), using 4x less visual tokens than most MLLMs. The model achieves **leading performance on OCRBench, surpassing proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest and Gemini 2.5**. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance for PDF document parsing capability on OmniDocBench among general MLLMs. Based on the latest [RLAIF-V](https://github.com/RLHF-V/RLAIF-V/) and [VisCPM](https://github.com/OpenBMB/VisCPM) techniques, it features **trustworthy behaviors**, outperforming GPT-4o-latest on MMHal-Bench, and supports **multilingual capabilities** in more than 30 languages.\n\n- 💫 **Easy Usage.**\nMiniCPM-V 4.5 can be easily used in various ways: (1) [llama.cpp](https://github.com/tc-mb/llama.cpp/blob/Support-MiniCPM-V-4.5/docs/multimodal/minicpmv4.5.md) and [ollama](https://github.com/tc-mb/ollama/tree/MIniCPM-V) support for efficient CPU inference on local devices, (2) [int4](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5-int4), [GGUF](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5-gguf) and [AWQ](https://github.com/tc-mb/AutoAWQ) format quantized models in 16 sizes, (3) [SGLang](https://github.com/tc-mb/sglang/tree/main) and [vLLM](#efficient-inference-with-llamacpp-ollama-vllm) support for high-throughput and memory-efficient inference, (4) fine-tuning on new domains and tasks with [Transformers](https://github.com/tc-mb/transformers/tree/main) and [LLaMA-Factory](./docs/llamafactory_train_and_infer.md), (5) quick [local WebUI demo](#chat-with-our-demo-on-gradio), (6) optimized [local iOS app](https://github.com/tc-mb/MiniCPM-o-demo-iOS) on iPhone and iPad, and (7) online web demo on [server](http://101.126.42.235:30910/).

By grouping and jointly compressing up to 6 consecutive video frames into just 64 tokens (the same token count used for a single image in MiniCPM-V series), MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves a 96× compression rate for video tokens. This allows the model to process more video frames without additional LLM computational cost, enabling high-FPS video and long video understanding. The architecture supports unified encoding for images, multi-image inputs, and videos, ensuring seamless capability and knowledge transfer.\n\n- **Pre-training: Unified Learning for OCR and Knowledge from Documents.** Existing MLLMs learn OCR capability and knowledge from documents in isolated training approaches. We observe that the essential difference between these two training approaches is the visibility of the text in images. By dynamically corrupting text regions in documents with varying noise levels and asking the model to reconstruct the text, the model learns to adaptively and properly switch between accurate text recognition (when text is visible) and multimodal context-based knowledge reasoning (when text is heavily obscured). This eliminates reliance on error-prone document parsers in knowledge learning from documents, and prevents hallucinations from over-augmented OCR data, resulting in top-tier OCR and multimodal knowledge performance with minimal engineering overhead.\n\n- **Post-training: Hybrid Fast/Deep Thinking with Multimodal RL.** MiniCPM-V 4.5 offers a balanced reasoning experience through two switchable modes: fast thinking for efficient daily use and deep thinking for complex tasks. Using a new hybrid reinforcement learning method, the model jointly optimizes both modes, significantly enhancing fast-mode performance without compromising deep-mode capability. Incorporated with [RLPR](https://github.com/OpenBMB/RLPR) and [RLAIF-V](https://github.com/RLHF-V/RLAIF-V), it generalizes robust reasoning skills from broad multimodal data while effectively reducing hallucinations.\n\n### Evaluation\n\n<div align="center">\n  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openbmb/MiniCPM-o/main/assets/radar_minicpm_v45.png", width=60%>\n</div>\n<div align="center">\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openbmb/MiniCPM-o/main/assets/minicpmv_4_5_evaluation_result.png" , width=100%>\n</div>\n\n### Inference Efficiency \n\n**OpenCompass**\n<div align="left">\n<table style="margin: 0px auto;">\n    <thead>\n            <tr>\n              <th align="left">Model</th>\n              <th>Size</th>\n              <th>Avg Score ↑</th>\n              <th>Total Inference Time ↓</th>\n            </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody align="center">\n        <tr>\n            <td nowrap="nowrap" align="left">GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking</td>\n            <td>10.3B</td>\n            <td>76.6</td>\n            <td>17.5h</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td nowrap="nowrap" align="left">MiMo-VL-7B-RL</td>\n            <td>8.3B</td>\n            <td>76.4</td>\n            <td>11h</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td nowrap="nowrap" align="left">MiniCPM-V 4.5</td>\n            <td>8.7B</td>\n            <td><b>77.0</td>\n            <td><b>7.5h</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n**Video-MME**\n\n<div align="left">\n<table style="margin: 0px auto;">\n    <thead>\n          <tr>\n              <th align="left">Model</th>\n              <th>Size</th>\n              <th>Avg Score ↑</th>\n              <th>Total Inference Time ↓</th>\n              <th>GPU Mem ↓</th>\n          </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody align="center">\n          <tr>\n              <td nowrap="nowrap" align="left">Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct</td>\n              <td>8.3B</td>\n              <td>71.6</td>\n              <td>3h</td>\n              <td>60G</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n              <td nowrap="nowrap" align="left">GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking</td>\n              <td>10.3B</td>\n              <td><b>73.6</td>\n              <td>2.63h</td>\n              <td>32G</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n              <td nowrap="nowrap" align="left">MiniCPM-V 4.5</td>\n              <td>8.7B</td>\n              <td>73.5</td>\n              <td><b>0.26h</td>\n              <td><b>28G</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\nBoth Video-MME and OpenCompass were evaluated using 8×A100 GPUs for inference.

Karst landscapes are characterized by distinctive, jagged limestone hills or mountains with steep, irregular peaks and deep valleys—exactly what you see here These unique formations result from the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone over millions of years through water erosion.\n\nThis scene closely resembles the famous karst landscape of Guilin and Yangshuo in China’s Guangxi Province. The area features dramatic, pointed limestone peaks rising dramatically above serene rivers and lush green forests, creating a breathtaking and iconic natural beauty that attracts millions of visitors each year for its picturesque views.\n\n# round2\nWhen traveling to a karst landscape like this, here are some important tips:\n\n1. Wear comfortable shoes: The terrain can be uneven and hilly.\n2. Bring water and snacks for energy during hikes or boat rides.\n3. Protect yourself from the sun with sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses—especially since you’ll likely spend time outdoors exploring scenic spots.\n4. Respect local customs and nature regulations by not littering or disturbing wildlife.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you''ll have a safe and enjoyable trip while appreciating the stunning natural beauty of places such as Guilin’s karst mountains.\n```\n\n\n#### Chat with Video\n\n```python\n## The 3d-resampler compresses multiple frames into 64 tokens by introducing temporal_ids. \n# To achieve this, you need to organize your video data into two corresponding sequences: \n#   frames: List[Image]\n#   temporal_ids: List[List[Int]].\n\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer\nfrom decord import VideoReader, cpu    # pip install decord\nfrom scipy.spatial import cKDTree\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(''openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5'', trust_remote_code=True,  # or openbmb/MiniCPM-o-2_6\n    attn_implementation=''sdpa'', torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16) # sdpa or flash_attention_2, no eager\nmodel = model.eval().cuda()\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(''openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5'', trust_remote_code=True)  # or openbmb/MiniCPM-o-2_6\n\nMAX_NUM_FRAMES=180 # Indicates the maximum number of frames received after the videos are packed.

The model is available on HuggingFace. We think Fuyu-8B is exciting because:\n1. It has a much simpler architecture and training procedure than other multi-modal models, which makes it easier to understand, scale, and deploy.\n2. It’s designed from the ground up for digital agents, so it can support arbitrary image resolutions, answer questions about graphs and diagrams, answer UI-based questions, and do fine-grained localization on screen images.\n3. It’s fast - we can get responses for large images in less than 100 milliseconds.\n4. Despite being optimized for our use-case, it performs well at standard image understanding benchmarks such as visual question-answering and natural-image-captioning.\n\nPlease note that **the model we have released is a base model. We expect you to need to finetune the model for specific use cases like verbose captioning or multimodal chat.** In our experience, the model responds well to few-shotting and fine-tuning for a variety of use-cases. \n\n## Model\n\n[Fuyu-8B](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b) is a multi-modal text and image transformer trained by [Adept AI](https://www.adept.ai/).\n\nArchitecturally, Fuyu is a vanilla decoder-only transformer - there is no image encoder. \nImage patches are instead linearly projected into the first layer of the transformer, bypassing the embedding lookup. \nWe simply treat the transformer decoder like an image transformer (albeit with no pooling and causal attention).\nSee the below diagram for more details.\n\n![architecture](architecture.png)\n\nThis simplification allows us to support arbitrary image resolutions. \nTo accomplish this, we treat the sequence of image tokens like the sequence of text tokens. \nWe remove image-specific position embeddings and feed in as many image tokens as necessary in raster-scan order. \nTo tell the model when a line has broken, we simply use a special image-newline character. \nThe model can use its existing position embeddings to reason about different image sizes, and we can use images of arbitrary size at training time, removing the need for separate high and low-resolution training stages.\n\n### Model Description\n\n- **Developed by:** Adept-AI\n- **Model type:** Decoder-only multi-modal transformer model \n- **License:** [CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.en)\n- **Model Description:** This is a multi-modal model that can consume images and text and produce text. \n- **Resources for more information:** Check out our [blog post](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b).\n\n## Evaluation\nThough not the focus of this model, we did evaluate it on standard image understanding benchmarks:\n\n|

n/a         |\n\n## How to Use\n\nYou can load the model and perform inference as follows:\n```python\nfrom transformers import FuyuProcessor, FuyuForCausalLM\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\n# load model and processor\nmodel_id = "adept/fuyu-8b"\nprocessor = FuyuProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = FuyuForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="cuda:0")\n\n# prepare inputs for the model\ntext_prompt = "Generate a coco-style caption.\n"\nurl = "https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b/resolve/main/bus.png"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\ninputs = processor(text=text_prompt, images=image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")\n\n# autoregressively generate text\ngeneration_output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=7)\ngeneration_text = processor.batch_decode(generation_output[:, -7:], skip_special_tokens=True)\nassert generation_text == [''A blue bus parked on the side of a road.'']\n```\n\nN.B.: The token `|SPEAKER|` is a placeholder token for image patch embeddings, so it will show up in the model context (e.g., in the portion of `generation_output` representing the model context).\n`|NEWLINE|` is the "image newline" token, denoting new rows in the raster scan order input of the image patches.\n`\x04` is the "beginning of answer" token.\n\nFuyu can also perform some question answering on natural images and charts/diagrams (thought fine-tuning may be required for good performance):\n```python\ntext_prompt = "What color is the bus?\n"\nurl = "https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b/resolve/main/bus.png"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\ninputs = processor(text=text_prompt, images=image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")\n\ngeneration_output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=6)\ngeneration_text = processor.batch_decode(generation_output[:, -6:], skip_special_tokens=True)\nassert generation_text == ["The bus is blue.\n"]\n\n\ntext_prompt = "What is the highest life expectancy at birth of male?\n"\nurl = "https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b/resolve/main/chart.png"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nmodel_inputs = processor(text=text_prompt, images=image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")\n\ngeneration_output = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=16)\ngeneration_text = processor.batch_decode(generation_output[:, -16:], skip_special_tokens=True)\nassert generation_text == ["The life expectancy at birth of males in 2018 is 80.7.\n"]\n```\nFor best performance, it''s recommended to end questions with `\n`, as shown above!\n\n## Uses\n\n### Direct Use\n\nThe model is intended for research purposes only. \n**Because this is a raw model release, we have not added further finetuning, postprocessing or sampling strategies to control for undesirable outputs. You should expect to have to fine-tune the model for your use-case.**\n\nPossible research areas and tasks include\n\n- Applications in computer control or digital agents.\n- Research on multi-modal models generally.\n\nExcluded uses are described below.\n\n### Out-of-Scope Use\n\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n## Limitations and Bias\n\n### Limitations\n\n- Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.\n\n### Bias\nWhile the capabilities of these models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases.', '{"pipeline_tag":"any-to-any","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":9408238592,"storage_bytes":37678352448,"files_count":17,"spaces_count":55,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["FuyuForCausalLM"],"model_type":"fuyu","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"|ENDOFTEXT|","eos_token":"|ENDOFTEXT|","pad_token":null,"unk_token":"<unk>","use_default_system_prompt":true}}}', '[]', '[]', NULL, 'CC-BY-NC-4.0', 'approved', 85, '1581e56ae03f606824f18ca395ff8b44', NULL, 'https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b/resolve/main/architecture.png', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Compared to the previous version, this upgrade brings improvements in multiple aspects:\n\n- **Hybrid thinking mode**: One model supports both thinking mode and non-thinking mode by changing the chat template. \n\n- **Smarter tool calling**: Through post-training optimization, the model''s performance in tool usage and agent tasks has significantly improved.\n\n- **Higher thinking efficiency**: DeepSeek-V3.1-Think achieves comparable answer quality to DeepSeek-R1-0528, while responding more quickly.\n\nDeepSeek-V3.1 is post-trained on the top of DeepSeek-V3.1-Base, which is built upon the original V3 base checkpoint through a two-phase long context extension approach, following the methodology outlined in the original DeepSeek-V3 report. We have expanded our dataset by collecting additional long documents and substantially extending both training phases. The 32K extension phase has been increased 10-fold to 630B tokens, while the 128K extension phase has been extended by 3.3x to 209B tokens.\n\nAdditionally, DeepSeek-V3.1 is trained using the **UE8M0 FP8 scale data format on both model weights and activations** to ensure compatibility with microscaling data formats. Please refer to [DeepGEMM](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM) for more details.\n\n## Model Downloads\n\n<div align="center">\n\n| **Model** | **#Total Params** | **#Activated Params** | **Context Length** | **Download** |\n| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |\n| DeepSeek-V3.1-Base | 671B | 37B | 128K | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1-Base) \| [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1-Base) |\n| DeepSeek-V3.1 | 671B | 37B | 128K | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1) \| [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1) |\n\n</div>\n\n## Chat Template\n\nThe details of our chat template is described in `tokenizer_config.json` and `assets/chat_template.jinja`. Here is a brief description.\n\n### Non-Thinking\n\n#### First-Turn\n\nPrefix:\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>`\n\nWith the given prefix, DeepSeek V3.1 generates responses to queries in non-thinking mode. Unlike DeepSeek V3,  it introduces an additional token `</think>`.\n\n#### Multi-Turn\nContext:\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>{response}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>...<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>{response}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>`\n\nPrefix:\n`<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>`\n\nBy concatenating the context and the prefix, we obtain the correct prompt for the query.\n\n### Thinking\n\n#### First-Turn\nPrefix:\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜><think>`\n\nThe prefix of thinking mode is similar to DeepSeek-R1. \n\n\n#### Multi-Turn\nContext:\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>{response}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>...<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>{response}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>`\n\nPrefix:\n`<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜><think>`\n\nThe multi-turn template is the same with non-thinking multi-turn chat template. It means the thinking token in the last turn will be dropped but the `</think>` is retained in every turn of context. \n\n### ToolCall\nToolcall is supported in non-thinking mode. The format is: \n\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}\n\n{tool_description}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>` where the tool_description is \n\n```\n## Tools\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n### {tool_name1}\nDescription: {description}\n\nParameters: {json.dumps(parameters)}\n\nIMPORTANT: ALWAYS adhere to this exact format for tool use:\n<｜tool▁calls▁begin｜><｜tool▁call▁begin｜>tool_call_name<｜tool▁sep｜>tool_call_arguments<｜tool▁call▁end｜>{additional_tool_calls}<｜tool▁calls▁end｜>\n\nWhere:\n- `tool_call_name` must be an exact match to one of the available tools\n- `tool_call_arguments` must be valid JSON that strictly follows the tool''s Parameters Schema\n- For multiple tool calls, chain them directly without separators or spaces\n```\n\n### Code-Agent\nWe support various code agent frameworks. Please refer to the above toolcall format to create your own code agents. An example is shown in `assets/code_agent_trajectory.html`.\n\n### Search-Agent\nWe design a specific format for searching toolcall in thinking mode, to support search agent. \n\nFor complex questions that require accessing external or up-to-date information, DeepSeek-V3.1 can leverage a user-provided search tool through a multi-turn tool-calling process.\n\nPlease refer to the `assets/search_tool_trajectory.html` and `assets/search_python_tool_trajectory.html` for the detailed template.\n\n## Evaluation\n| Category | Benchmark (Metric)              | DeepSeek V3.1-NonThinking | DeepSeek V3 0324 | DeepSeek V3.1-Thinking     | DeepSeek R1 0528\n|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------|---|---|---|\n| General  |\n|          | MMLU-Redux (EM)              | 91.8     | 90.5    | 93.7          | 93.4\n|          | MMLU-Pro (EM)                  | 83.7  | 81.2    | 84.8          | 85.0\n|          | GPQA-Diamond (Pass@1)           | 74.9   | 68.4   | 80.1            | 81.0\n|          | Humanity''s Last Exam (Pass@1)   | -    |       -            | 15.9         | 17.7\n|Search Agent| \n|          | BrowseComp       | -      | -  | 30.0 | 8.9\n|          | BrowseComp_zh       | -     | -  | 49.2      | 35.7\n|          | Humanity''s Last Exam (Python + Search)      |-   | -    | 29.8         | 24.8\n|          | SimpleQA             | -      | -    | 93.4  | 92.3\n| Code |\n|          | LiveCodeBench (2408-2505) (Pass@1)     | 56.4    | 43.0    | 74.8          | 73.3\n|          | Codeforces-Div1 (Rating)        | -   | -    | 2091            | 1930\n|          | Aider-Polyglot (Acc.)           | 68.4    | 55.1   | 76.3           | 71.6\n| Code Agent|\n|          | SWE Verified (Agent mode)           | 66.0       | 45.4  | -    | 44.6\n|          | SWE-bench Multilingual (Agent mode)         | 54.5    | 29.3   | -            | 30.5\n|          | Terminal-bench (Terminus 1 framework)       | 31.3     | 13.3      | -         | 5.7\n| Math |\n|          | AIME 2024 (Pass@1)                | 66.3     | 59.4     | 93.1      | 91.4\n|          | AIME 2025 (Pass@1)                     | 49.8  | 51.3 | 88.4          | 87.5\n|          | HMMT 2025 (Pass@1)        | 33.5    | 29.2   | 84.2 | 79.4 |\n\nNote: \n- Search agents are evaluated with our internal search framework, which uses a commercial search API + webpage filter + 128K context window.

For details on the user study, we refer to the [research paper](https://stability.ai/research/stable-video-diffusion-scaling-latent-video-diffusion-models-to-large-datasets)\n\n## Uses\n\n### Direct Use\n\nThe model is intended for research purposes only. Possible research areas and tasks include\n\n- Research on generative models.\n- Safe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.\n- Probing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.\n- Generation of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.\n- Applications in educational or creative tools.\n\nExcluded uses are described below.\n\n### Out-of-Scope Use\n\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, \nand therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\nThe model should not be used in any way that violates Stability AI''s [Acceptable Use Policy](https://stability.ai/use-policy).\n\n## Limitations and Bias\n\n### Limitations\n- The generated videos are rather short (<= 4sec), and the model does not achieve perfect photorealism.\n- The model may generate videos without motion, or very slow camera pans.\n- The model cannot be controlled through text.\n- The model cannot render legible text.\n- Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.\n- The autoencoding part of the model is lossy.\n\n\n### Recommendations\n\nThe model is intended for research purposes only.\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model\n\nCheck out https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models\n\n\n\n# Appendix:\nAll considered potential data sources were included for final training, with none held out as the proposed data filtering methods described in the SVD paper handle the quality control/filtering of the dataset. With regards to safety/NSFW filtering, sources considered were either deemed safe or filtered with the in-house NSFW filters. No explicit human labor is involved in training data preparation. However, human evaluation for model outputs and quality was extensively used to evaluate model quality and performance. The evaluations were performed with third-party contractor platforms (Amazon Sagemaker, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Prolific) with fluent English-speaking contractors from various countries, primarily from the USA, UK, and Canada. Each worker was paid $12/hr for the time invested in the evaluation. No other third party was involved in the development of this model; the model was fully developed in-house at Stability AI. Training the SVD checkpoints required a total of approximately 200,000 A100 80GB hours. The majority of the training occurred on 48 * 8 A100s, while some stages took more/less than that. The resulting CO2 emission is ~19,000kg CO2 eq., and energy consumed is ~64000 kWh. The released checkpoints (SVD/SVD-XT) are image-to-video models that generate short videos/animations closely following the given input image. Since the model relies on an existing supplied image, the potential risks of disclosing specific material or novel unsafe content are minimal. This was also evaluated by third-party independent red-teaming services, which agree with our conclusion to a high degree of confidence (>90% in various areas of safety red-teaming). The external evaluations were also performed for trustworthiness, leading to >95% confidence in real, trustworthy videos. With the default settings at the time of release, SVD takes ~100s for generation, and SVD-XT takes ~180s on an A100 80GB card. Several optimizations to trade off quality / memory / speed can be done to perform faster inference or inference on lower VRAM cards. The information related to the model and its development process and usage protocols can be found in the GitHub repo, associated research paper, and HuggingFace model page/cards. The released model inference & demo code has image-level watermarking enabled by default, which can be used to detect the outputs. This is done via the imWatermark Python library.\nThe model can be used to generate videos from static initial images. However, we prohibit unlawful, obscene, or misleading uses of the model consistent with the terms of our license and Acceptable Use Policy. For the open-weights release, our training data filtering mitigations alleviate this risk to some extent. These restrictions are explicitly enforced on user-facing interfaces at stablevideo.com, where a warning is issued. We do not take any responsibility for third-party interfaces. Submitting initial images that bypass input filters to tease out offensive or inappropriate content listed above is also prohibited. Safety filtering checks at stablevideo.com run on model inputs and outputs independently. More details on our user-facing interfaces can be found here: https://www.stablevideo.com/faq. Beyond the Acceptable Use Policy and other mitigations and conditions described here, the model is not subject to additional model behavior interventions of the type described in the Foundation Model Transparency Index.\nFor stablevideo.com, we store preference data in the form of upvotes/downvotes on user-generated videos, and we have a pairwise ranker that runs while a user generates videos. This usage data is solely used for improving Stability AI’s future image/video models and services. No other third-party entities are given access to the usage data beyond Stability AI and maintainers of stablevideo.com. For usage statistics of SVD, we refer interested users to HuggingFace model download/usage statistics as a primary indicator. Third-party applications also have reported model usage statistics. We might also consider releasing aggregate usage statistics of stablevideo.com on reaching some milestones.', '{"pipeline_tag":"image-to-video","library_name":"diffusers","framework":"diffusers","params":null,"storage_bytes":32608765959,"files_count":19,"spaces_count":97,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"diffusers":{"_class_name":"StableVideoDiffusionPipeline"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Stability-AI:generative-models","source_url":"https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Stability-AI:generative-models","source_url":"https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Stability-AI:generative-models","source_url":"https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models"}]', NULL, 'Other', 'approved', 65, '4972f0d945118055291a5246d77335aa', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Introduction\n\nThe DeepSeek R1 model has undergone a minor version upgrade, with the current version being DeepSeek-R1-0528. In the latest update, DeepSeek R1 has significantly improved its depth of reasoning and inference capabilities by leveraging increased computational resources and introducing algorithmic optimization mechanisms during post-training. The model has demonstrated outstanding performance across various benchmark evaluations, including mathematics, programming, and general logic. Its overall performance is now approaching that of leading models, such as O3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="80%" src="figures/benchmark.png">\n</p>\n\nCompared to the previous version, the upgraded model shows significant improvements in handling complex reasoning tasks. For instance, in the AIME 2025 test, the model’s accuracy has increased from 70% in the previous version to 87.5% in the current version. This advancement stems from enhanced thinking depth during the reasoning process: in the AIME test set, the previous model used an average of 12K tokens per question, whereas the new version averages 23K tokens per question.\n\nBeyond its improved reasoning capabilities, this version also offers a reduced hallucination rate, enhanced support for function calling, and better experience for vibe coding.\n\n## 2. Evaluation Results\n\n### DeepSeek-R1-0528\n For all our models, the maximum generation length is set to 64K tokens. For benchmarks requiring sampling, we use a temperature of $0.6$, a top-p value of $0.95$, and generate 16 responses per query to estimate pass@1.\n<div align="center">\n\n| Category | Benchmark (Metric)               | DeepSeek R1     | DeepSeek R1 0528\n|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------|---|\n| General  |\n|          | MMLU-Redux (EM)                   | 92.9            | 93.4\n|          | MMLU-Pro (EM)                     | 84.0            | 85.0\n|          | GPQA-Diamond (Pass@1)             | 71.5            | 81.0\n|          | SimpleQA (Correct)                | 30.1            | 27.8\n|          | FRAMES (Acc.)                     | 82.5            | 83.0\n|          | Humanity''s Last Exam (Pass@1)                     | 8.5            | 17.7\n| Code |\n|          | LiveCodeBench (2408-2505) (Pass@1)        | 63.5          | 73.3\n|          | Codeforces-Div1 (Rating)          | 1530            | 1930\n|          | SWE Verified (Resolved)           | 49.2            | 57.6\n|          | Aider-Polyglot (Acc.)             | 53.3            | 71.6\n| Math |\n|          | AIME 2024 (Pass@1)                | 79.8            | 91.4\n|          | AIME 2025 (Pass@1)                     | 70.0           | 87.5\n|          | HMMT 2025 (Pass@1)            | 41.7 | 79.4 |\n|          | CNMO 2024 (Pass@1)                | 78.8            | 86.9\n| Tools |\n|          | BFCL_v3_MultiTurn (Acc)     | -            | 37.0 |\n|          | Tau-Bench   (Pass@1)       | -            | 53.5(Airline)/63.9(Retail)\n\n</div>\nNote: We use Agentless framework to evaluate model performance on SWE-Verified.

This model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models on the AIME 2024, surpassing Qwen3 8B by +10.0% and matching the performance of Qwen3-235B-thinking. We believe that the chain-of-thought from DeepSeek-R1-0528 will hold significant importance for both academic research on reasoning models and industrial development focused on small-scale models.\n\n|                                | AIME 24 | AIME 25 | HMMT Feb 25 | GPQA Diamond | LiveCodeBench (2408-2505) |\n|--------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| Qwen3-235B-A22B	                | 85.7    | 81.5    | 62.5        | 71.1         | 66.5                  |\n| Qwen3-32B                      | 81.4    | 72.9    | -           | 68.4         | -                         |\n| Qwen3-8B                      | 76.0   | 67.3    | -           | 62.0       | -                         |\n| Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus-14B       | 81.3    | 78.0    | 53.6        | 69.3         | -          |\n| Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking-0520 | 82.3    | 72.0    | 64.2        | 82.8         | 62.3                  |\n| o3-mini (medium)               | 79.6    | 76.7    | 53.3        | 76.8         | 65.9                     |\n| DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B      | 86.0   | 76.3    | 61.5        | 61.1         | 60.5                      |\n\n## 3. Chat Website & API Platform\nYou can chat with DeepSeek-R1 on DeepSeek''s official website: [chat.deepseek.com](https://chat.deepseek.com/sign_in), and switch on the button "DeepThink"\n\nWe also provide OpenAI-Compatible API at DeepSeek Platform: [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/)\n\n## 4. How to Run Locally\n\nPlease visit [DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) repository for more information about running DeepSeek-R1-0528 locally.\n\nCompared to previous versions of DeepSeek-R1, the usage recommendations for DeepSeek-R1-0528 have the following changes:\n\n1. System prompt is supported now.\n2. It is not required to add "\<think\>\n" at the beginning of the output to force the model into thinking pattern.\n\nThe model architecture of DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is identical to that of Qwen3-8B, but it shares the same tokenizer configuration as DeepSeek-R1-0528. This model can be run in the same manner as Qwen3-8B, but it is essential to ensure that all configuration files are sourced from our repository rather than the original Qwen3 project.\n\n### System Prompt\nIn the official DeepSeek web/app, we use the same system prompt with a specific date.\n```\n该助手为DeepSeek-R1，由深度求索公司创造。\n今天是{current date}。\n```\nFor example,\n```\n该助手为DeepSeek-R1，由深度求索公司创造。\n今天是2025年5月28日，星期一。\n```\n### Temperature\nIn our web and application environments, the temperature parameter $T_{model}$ is set to 0.6. \n### Prompts for File Uploading and Web Search\nFor file uploading, please follow the template to create prompts, where {file_name}, {file_content} and {question} are arguments.\n```\nfile_template = \\n"""[file name]: {file_name}\n[file content begin]\n{file_content}\n[file content end]\n{question}"""\n```\nFor Web Search, {search_results}, {cur_date}, and {question} are arguments.\nFor Chinese query, we use the prompt:\n```\nsearch_answer_zh_template = \\n''''''# 以下内容是基于用户发送的消息的搜索结果:\n{search_results}\n在我给你的搜索结果中，每个结果都是[webpage X begin]...[webpage X end]格式的，X代表每篇文章的数字索引。请在适当的情况下在句子末尾引用上下文。请按照引用编号[citation:X]的格式在答案中对应部分引用上下文。如果一句话源自多个上下文，请列出所有相关的引用编号，例如[citation:3][citation:5]，切记不要将引用集中在最后返回引用编号，而是在答案对应部分列出。\n在回答时，请注意以下几点：\n- 今天是{cur_date}。\n- 并非搜索结果的所有内容都与用户的问题密切相关，你需要结合问题，对搜索结果进行甄别、筛选。\n- 对于列举类的问题（如列举所有航班信息），尽量将答案控制在10个要点以内，并告诉用户可以查看搜索来源、获得完整信息。优先提供信息完整、最相关的列举项；如非必要，不要主动告诉用户搜索结果未提供的内容。\n- 对于创作类的问题（如写论文），请务必在正文的段落中引用对应的参考编号，例如[citation:3][citation:5]，不能只在文章末尾引用。你需要解读并概括用户的题目要求，选择合适的格式，充分利用搜索结果并抽取重要信息，生成符合用户要求、极具思想深度、富有创造力与专业性的答案。你的创作篇幅需要尽可能延长，对于每一个要点的论述要推测用户的意图，给出尽可能多角度的回答要点，且务必信息量大、论述详尽。\n- 如果回答很长，请尽量结构化、分段落总结。如果需要分点作答，尽量控制在5个点以内，并合并相关的内容。\n- 对于客观类的问答，如果问题的答案非常简短，可以适当补充一到两句相关信息，以丰富内容。\n- 你需要根据用户要求和回答内容选择合适、美观的回答格式，确保可读性强。\n- 你的回答应该综合多个相关网页来回答，不能重复引用一个网页。\n- 除非用户要求，否则你回答的语言需要和用户提问的语言保持一致。\n# 用户消息为：\n{question}''''''\n```\nFor English query, we use the prompt:\n```\nsearch_answer_en_template = \\n''''''# The following contents are the search results related to the user''s message:\n{search_results}\nIn the search results I provide to you, each result is formatted as [webpage X begin]...[webpage X end], where X represents the numerical index of each article. Please cite the context at the end of the relevant sentence when appropriate. Use the citation format [citation:X] in the corresponding part of your answer. If a sentence is derived from multiple contexts, list all relevant citation numbers, such as [citation:3][citation:5]. Be sure not to cluster all citations at the end; instead, include them in the corresponding parts of the answer.\nWhen responding, please keep the following points in mind:\n- Today is {cur_date}.\n- Not all content in the search results is closely related to the user''s question. You need to evaluate and filter the search results based on the question.\n- For listing-type questions (e.g., listing all flight information), try to limit the answer to 10 key points and inform the user that they can refer to the search sources for complete information. Prioritize providing the most complete and relevant items in the list. Avoid mentioning content not provided in the search results unless necessary.\n- For creative tasks (e.g., writing an essay), ensure that references are cited within the body of the text, such as [citation:3][citation:5], rather than only at the end of the text. You need to interpret and summarize the user''s requirements, choose an appropriate format, fully utilize the search results, extract key information, and generate an answer that is insightful, creative, and professional. Extend the length of your response as much as possible, addressing each point in detail and from multiple perspectives, ensuring the content is rich and thorough.\n- If the response is lengthy, structure it well and summarize it in paragraphs. If a point-by-point format is needed, try to limit it to 5 points and merge related content.\n- For objective Q&A, if the answer is very brief, you may add one or two related sentences to enrich the content.\n- Choose an appropriate and visually appealing format for your response based on the user''s requirements and the content of the answer, ensuring strong readability.\n- Your answer should synthesize information from multiple relevant webpages and avoid repeatedly citing the same webpage.\n- Unless the user requests otherwise, your response should be in the same language as the user''s question.\n# The user''s message is:\n{question}''''''\n```\n\n## 5.

Our text-to-image module achieves performance **comparable to or surpassing** leading closed-source models.\n\n\n<div align="center">\n  <img src="./assets/framework.png" alt="HunyuanImage-3.0 Framework" width="90%">\n</div>\n\n## ✨ Key Features\n\n* 🧠 **Unified Multimodal Architecture:** Moving beyond the prevalent DiT-based architectures, HunyuanImage-3.0 employs a unified autoregressive framework. This design enables a more direct and integrated modeling of text and image modalities, leading to surprisingly effective and contextually rich image generation.\n\n* 🏆 **The Largest Image Generation MoE Model:** This is the largest open-source image generation Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to date. It features 64 experts and a total of 80 billion parameters, with 13 billion activated per token, significantly enhancing its capacity and performance.\n\n* 🎨 **Superior Image Generation Performance:** Through rigorous dataset curation and advanced reinforcement learning post-training, we''ve achieved an optimal balance between semantic accuracy and visual excellence. The model demonstrates exceptional prompt adherence while delivering photorealistic imagery with stunning aesthetic quality and fine-grained details.\n\n* 💭 **Intelligent World-Knowledge Reasoning:** The unified multimodal architecture endows HunyuanImage-3.0 with powerful reasoning capabilities. It leverages its extensive world knowledge to intelligently interpret user intent, automatically elaborating on sparse prompts with contextually appropriate details to produce superior, more complete visual outputs.\n\n\n## 🛠️ Dependencies and Installation\n\n### 💻 System Requirements\n\n* 🖥️ **Operating System:** Linux\n* 🎮 **GPU:** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support\n* 💾 **Disk Space:** 170GB for model weights\n* 🧠 **GPU Memory:** ≥3×80GB (4×80GB recommended for better performance)\n\n### 📦 Environment Setup\n\n* 🐍 **Python:** 3.12+ (recommended and tested)\n* 🔥 **PyTorch:** 2.7.1\n* ⚡ **CUDA:** 12.8\n\n### 📥 Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\n# 1. First install PyTorch (CUDA 12.8 Version)\npip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision==0.22.1 torchaudio==2.7.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128\n\n# 2. Then install tencentcloud-sdk\npip install -i https://mirrors.tencent.com/pypi/simple/ --upgrade tencentcloud-sdk-python\n\n# 3. Then install other dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n#### Performance Optimizations\n\nFor **up to 3x faster inference**, install these optimizations:\n\n```bash\n# FlashAttention for faster attention computation\npip install flash-attn==2.8.3 --no-build-isolation\n\n# FlashInfer for optimized moe inference. v0.3.1 is tested.\npip install flashinfer-python\n```\n> 💡**Installation Tips:** It is critical that the CUDA version used by PyTorch matches the system''s CUDA version. \n> FlashInfer relies on this compatibility when compiling kernels at runtime. Pytorch 2.7.1+cu128 is tested.\n> GCC version >=9 is recommended for compiling FlashAttention and FlashInfer.\n\n> ⚡ **Performance Tips:** These optimizations can significantly speed up your inference!\n\n> 💡**Notation:** When FlashInfer is enabled, the first inference may be slower (about 10 minutes) due to kernel compilation. Subsequent inferences on the same machine will be much faster.\n\n## 🚀 Usage\n\n### 🔥 Quick Start with Transformers\n\n#### 1️⃣ Download model weights\n\n```bash\n# Download from HuggingFace and rename the directory.\n# Notice that the directory name should not contain dots, which may cause issues when loading using Transformers.\nhf download tencent/HunyuanImage-3.0 --local-dir ./HunyuanImage-3\n```\n\n#### 2️⃣ Run with Transformers\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\n\n# Load the model\nmodel_id = "./HunyuanImage-3"\n# Currently we can not load the model using HF model_id `tencent/HunyuanImage-3.0` directly \n# due to the dot in the name.\n\nkwargs = dict(\n    attn_implementation="sdpa",     # Use "flash_attention_2" if FlashAttention is installed\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n    torch_dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto",\n    moe_impl="eager",   # Use "flashinfer" if FlashInfer is installed\n)\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, **kwargs)\nmodel.load_tokenizer(model_id)\n\n# generate the image\nprompt = "A brown and white dog is running on the grass"\nimage = model.generate_image(prompt=prompt, stream=True)\nimage.save("image.png")\n```\n\n### 🏠 Local Installation & Usage\n\n#### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0.git\ncd HunyuanImage-3.0/\n```\n\n#### 2️⃣ Download Model Weights\n\n```bash\n# Download from HuggingFace\nhf download tencent/HunyuanImage-3.0 --local-dir ./HunyuanImage-3\n```\n\n#### 3️⃣ Run the Demo\nThe Pretrain Checkpoint does not automatically rewrite or enhance input prompts, for optimal results currently, we recommend community partners to use deepseek to rewrite the prompts.

For optimal results currently, we recommend community partners consulting our official guide on how to write effective prompts.\n\nReference: [HunyuanImage 3.0 Prompt Handbook](\nhttps://docs.qq.com/doc/DUVVadmhCdG9qRXBU)\n\n\n### System Prompt For Automatic Rewriting the Prompt.\n\nWe''ve included two system prompts in the PE folder of this repository that leverage DeepSeek to automatically enhance user inputs:\n\n* **system_prompt_universal**: This system prompt converts photographic style, artistic prompts into a detailed one.\n* **system_prompt_text_rendering**: This system prompt converts UI/Poster/Text Rending prompts to a deailed on that suits the model.\n\nNote that these system prompts are in Chinese because Deepseek works better with Chinese system prompts. If you want to use it for English oriented model, you may translate it into English or refer to the comments in the PE file as a guide.\n\nWe also create a [Yuanqi workflow](https://yuanqi.tencent.com/agent/H69VgtJdj3Dz) to implement the universal one, you can directly try it.\n\n### Advanced Tips\n- **Content Priority**: Focus on describing the main subject and action first, followed by details about the environment and style. A more general description framework is: **Main subject and scene + Image quality and style + Composition and perspective + Lighting and atmosphere + Technical parameters**. Keywords can be added both before and after this structure.\n\n- **Image resolution**: Our model not only supports multiple resolutions but also offers both **automatic and specified resolution** options. In auto mode, the model automatically predicts the image resolution based on the input prompt. In specified mode (like traditional DiT), the model outputs an image resolution that strictly aligns with the user''s chosen resolution.\n\n### More Cases\nOur model can follow complex instructions to generate high‑quality, creative images.\n\n<div align="center">\n  <img src="./assets/banner_all.jpg" width=100% alt="HunyuanImage 3.0 Demo">\n</div>\n\nOur model can effectively process very long text inputs, enabling users to precisely control the finer details of generated images. Extended prompts allow for intricate elements to be accurately captured, making it ideal for complex projects requiring precision and creativity.\n\n<p align="center">\n<table>\n<thead>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src="./assets/pg_imgs/image1.png" width=100%><details>\n<summary>Show prompt</summary>\nA cinematic medium shot captures a single Asian woman seated on a chair within a dimly lit room, creating an intimate and theatrical atmosphere. The composition is focused on the subject, rendered with rich colors and intricate textures that evoke a nostalgic and moody feeling.\n\nThe primary subject is a young Asian woman with a thoughtful and expressive countenance, her gaze directed slightly away from the camera. She is seated in a relaxed yet elegant posture on an ornate, vintage armchair. The chair is upholstered in a deep red velvet, its fabric showing detailed, intricate textures and slight signs of wear. She wears a simple, elegant dress in a dark teal hue, the material catching the light in a way that reveals its fine-woven texture. Her skin has a soft, matte quality, and the light delicately models the contours of her face and arms.\n\nThe surrounding room is characterized by its vintage decor, which contributes to the historic and evocative mood. In the immediate background, partially blurred due to a shallow depth of field consistent with a f/2.8 aperture, the wall is covered with wallpaper featuring a subtle, damask pattern. The overall color palette is a carefully balanced interplay of deep teal and rich red hues, creating a visually compelling and cohesive environment. The entire scene is detailed, from the fibers of the upholstery to the subtle patterns on the wall.\n\nThe lighting is highly dramatic and artistic, defined by high contrast and pronounced shadow play. A single key light source, positioned off-camera, projects gobo lighting patterns onto the scene, casting intricate shapes of light and shadow across the woman and the back wall. These dramatic shadows create a strong sense of depth and a theatrical quality. While some shadows are deep and defined, others remain soft, gently wrapping around the subject and preventing the loss of detail in darker areas. The soft focus on the background enhances the intimate feeling, drawing all attention to the expressive subject. The overall image presents a cinematic, photorealistic photography style.\n</details>\n</td>\n<td><img src="./assets/pg_imgs/image2.png" width=100%><details>\n<summary>Show prompt</summary>\nA cinematic, photorealistic medium shot captures a high-contrast urban street corner, defined by the sharp intersection of light and shadow. The primary subject is the exterior corner of a building, rendered in a low-saturation, realistic style.\n\nThe building wall, which occupies the majority of the frame, is painted a warm orange with a finely detailed, rough stucco texture. Horizontal white stripes run across its surface. The base of the building is constructed from large, rough-hewn stone blocks, showing visible particles and texture. On the left, illuminated side of the building, there is a single window with closed, dark-colored shutters. Adjacent to the window, a simple black pendant lamp hangs from a thin, taut rope, casting a distinct, sharp-edged shadow onto the sunlit orange wall. The composition is split diagonally, with the right side of the building enveloped in a deep brown shadow. At the bottom of the frame, a smooth concrete sidewalk is visible, upon which the dynamic silhouette of a person is captured mid-stride, walking from right to left.\n\nIn the shallow background, the faint, out-of-focus outlines of another building and the bare, skeletal branches of trees are softly visible, contributing to the quiet urban atmosphere and adding a sense of depth to the scene. These elements are rendered with minimal detail to keep the focus on the foreground architecture.\n\nThe scene is illuminated by strong, natural sunlight originating from the upper left, creating a dramatic chiaroscuro effect. This hard light source casts deep, well-defined shadows, producing a sharp contrast between the brightly lit warm orange surfaces and the deep brown shadow areas. The lighting highlights the fine details in the wall texture and stone particles, emphasizing the photorealistic quality.

Evaluation\n\n* 🤖 **SSAE (Machine Evaluation)**   \nSSAE (Structured Semantic Alignment Evaluation) is an intelligent evaluation metric for image-text alignment based on advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We extracted 3500 key points across 12 categories, then used multimodal large language models to automatically evaluate and score by comparing the generated images with these key points based on the visual content of the images. Mean Image Accuracy represents the image-wise average score across all key points, while Global Accuracy directly calculates the average score across all key points.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="./assets/ssae_side_by_side_comparison.png" width=98% alt="Human Evaluation with Other Models">\n</p>\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="./assets/ssae_side_by_side_heatmap.png" width=98% alt="Human Evaluation with Other Models">\n</p>\n\n\n* 👥 **GSB (Human Evaluation)** \n\nWe adopted the GSB (Good/Same/Bad) evaluation method commonly used to assess the relative performance between two models from an overall image perception perspective. In total, we utilized 1,000 text prompts, generating an equal number of image samples for all compared models in a single run. For a fair comparison, we conducted inference only once for each prompt, avoiding any cherry-picking of results. When comparing with the baseline methods, we maintained the default settings for all selected models. The evaluation was performed by more than 100 professional evaluators. \n\n<p align="center">\n  <img src="./assets/gsb.png" width=98% alt="Human Evaluation with Other Models">\n</p>\n\n\n## 📚 Citation\n\nIf you find HunyuanImage-3.0 useful in your research, please cite our work:\n\n```bibtex\n@article{cao2025hunyuanimage,\n  title={HunyuanImage 3.0 Technical Report},\n  author={Cao, Siyu and Chen, Hangting and Chen, Peng and Cheng, Yiji and Cui, Yutao and Deng, Xinchi and Dong, Ying and Gong, Kipper and Gu, Tianpeng and Gu, Xiusen and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2509.23951},\n  year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n## 🙏 Acknowledgements\n\nWe extend our heartfelt gratitude to the following open-source projects and communities for their invaluable contributions:\n\n* 🤗 [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) - State-of-the-art NLP library\n* 🎨 [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) - Diffusion models library  \n* 🌐 [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) - AI model hub and community\n* ⚡ [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) - Memory-efficient attention\n* 🚀 [FlashInfer](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer) - Optimized inference engine\n\n## 🌟🚀 Github Star History\n\n[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0?style=social)](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0)\n[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0?style=social)](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0)\n\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0&type=Date)](https://www.star-history.com/#Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0&Date)', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-to-image","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":83009199459,"storage_bytes":168599289097,"files_count":68,"spaces_count":53,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["HunyuanImage3ForCausalMM"],"auto_map":{"AutoConfig":"configuration_hunyuan.HunyuanImage3Config","AutoModel":"hunyuan.HunyuanImage3Model","AutoModelForCausalLM":"hunyuan.HunyuanImage3ForCausalMM"},"model_type":"hunyuan_image_3_moe","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"<|startoftext|>","eos_token":"<|endoftext|>","pad_token":"<pad>"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Tencent-Hunyuan:HunyuanImage-3.0","source_url":"https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Tencent-Hunyuan:HunyuanImage-3.0.git","source_url":"https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0.git"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:diffusers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Dao-AILab:flash-attention","source_url":"https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:flashinfer-ai:flashinfer","source_url":"https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Tencent-Hunyuan:HunyuanImage-3.0","source_url":"https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Tencent-Hunyuan:HunyuanImage-3.0","source_url":"https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanImage-3.0"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2509.23951","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23951"}]', NULL, 'Other', 'approved', 100, '3b5f845b8cf66b8d47c3c990c28d1c27', NULL, 'https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanImage-3.0/resolve/main/assets/banner.png', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

These outputs include architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object bounding boxes with their semantic categories. Unlike previous methods that require specialized equipment for data collection, SpatialLM can handle point clouds from diverse sources such as monocular video sequences, RGBD images, and LiDAR sensors. This multimodal architecture effectively bridges the gap between unstructured 3D geometric data and structured 3D representations, offering high-level semantic understanding. It enhances spatial reasoning capabilities for applications in embodied robotics, autonomous navigation, and other complex 3D scene analysis tasks.\n\n<div align="center">\n  <video controls autoplay src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63efbb1efc92a63ac81126d0/3bz_jNRCLD2L9uj11HPnP.mp4" poster="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63efbb1efc92a63ac81126d0/euo94dNx28qBNe51_oiB1.png"></video>\n  <p><i>SpatialLM reconstructs 3D layout from a monocular RGB video with MASt3R-SLAM.

This orientation is crucial for maintaining consistency in spatial understanding and scene interpretation across different datasets and applications.\nExample preprocessed point clouds, reconstructed from RGB videos using [MASt3R-SLAM](https://github.com/rmurai0610/MASt3R-SLAM), are available in [SpatialLM-Testset](#spatiallm-testset).\n\nDownload an example point cloud:\n\n```bash\nhuggingface-cli download manycore-research/SpatialLM-Testset pcd/scene0000_00.ply --repo-type dataset --local-dir .\n```\n\nRun inference:\n\n```bash\npython inference.py --point_cloud pcd/scene0000_00.ply --output scene0000_00.txt --model_path manycore-research/SpatialLM-Llama-1B\n```\n\n### Visualization\n\nUse `rerun` to visualize the point cloud and the predicted structured 3D layout output:\n\n```bash\n# Convert the predicted layout to Rerun format\npython visualize.py --point_cloud pcd/scene0000_00.ply --layout scene0000_00.txt --save scene0000_00.rrd\n\n# Visualize the point cloud and the predicted layout\nrerun scene0000_00.rrd\n```\n\n### Evaluation\n\nTo evaluate the performance of SpatialLM, we provide `eval.py` script that reports the benchmark results on the SpatialLM-Testset in the table below in section [Benchmark Results](#benchmark-results).\n\nDownload the testset:\n\n```bash\nhuggingface-cli download manycore-research/SpatialLM-Testset --repo-type dataset --local-dir SpatialLM-Testset\n```\n\nRun evaluation:\n\n```bash\n# Run inference on the PLY point clouds in folder SpatialLM-Testset/pcd with SpatialLM-Llama-1B model\npython inference.py --point_cloud SpatialLM-Testset/pcd --output SpatialLM-Testset/pred --model_path manycore-research/SpatialLM-Llama-1B\n\n# Evaluate the predicted layouts\npython eval.py --metadata SpatialLM-Testset/test.csv --gt_dir SpatialLM-Testset/layout --pred_dir SpatialLM-Testset/pred --label_mapping SpatialLM-Testset/benchmark_categories.tsv\n```\n\n## SpatialLM Testset\n\nWe provide a test set of 107 preprocessed point clouds, reconstructed from RGB videos using [MASt3R-SLAM](https://github.com/rmurai0610/MASt3R-SLAM). SpatialLM-Testset is quite challenging compared to prior clean RGBD scans datasets due to the noises and occlusions in the point clouds reconstructed from monocular RGB videos.\n\n<div align="center">\n\n|    **Dataset**    | **Download**                                                                       |\n| :---------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| SpatialLM-Testset | [🤗 Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/manycore-research/SpatialLM-TestSet) |\n\n</div>\n\n## Benchmark Results\n\nBenchmark results on the challenging SpatialLM-Testset are reported in the following table:\n\n<div align="center">\n\n| **Method**       | **SpatialLM-Llama-1B** | **SpatialLM-Qwen-0.5B** |\n| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |\n| **Floorplan**    | **mean IoU**           |                         |\n| wall             | 78.62                  | 74.81                   |\n|                  |                        |                         |\n| **Objects**      | **F1 @.25 IoU (3D)**   |                         |\n| curtain          | 27.35                  | 28.59                   |\n| nightstand       | 57.47                  | 54.39                   |\n| chandelier       | 38.92                  | 40.12                   |\n| wardrobe         | 23.33                  | 30.60                   |\n| bed              | 95.24                  | 93.75                   |\n| sofa             | 65.50                  | 66.15                   |\n| chair            | 21.26                  | 14.94                   |\n| cabinet          | 8.47                   | 8.44                    |\n| dining table     | 54.26                  | 56.10                   |\n| plants           | 20.68                  | 26.46                   |\n| tv cabinet       | 33.33                  | 10.26                   |\n| coffee table     | 50.00                  | 55.56                   |\n| side table       | 7.60                   | 2.17                    |\n| air conditioner  | 20.00                  | 13.04                   |\n| dresser          | 46.67                  | 23.53                   |\n|                  |                        |                         |\n| **Thin Objects** | **F1 @.25 IoU (2D)**   |                         |\n| painting         | 50.04                  | 53.81                   |\n| carpet           | 31.76                  | 45.31                   |\n| tv               | 67.31                  | 52.29                   |\n| door             | 50.35                  | 42.15                   |\n| window           | 45.4                   | 45.9                    |\n\n</div>\n\n## License\n\nSpatialLM-Llama-1B is derived from Llama3.2-1B-Instruct, which is licensed under the Llama3.2 license.\nSpatialLM-Qwen-0.5B is derived from the Qwen-2.5 series, originally licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.\n\nAll models are built upon the SceneScript point cloud encoder, licensed under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 License.

[chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started), [guidance](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance), [semantic-kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) 。\n\n## 🎨 微调模型\n\n`uniem` 提供了非常易用的 finetune 接口，几行代码，即刻适配！\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nfrom uniem.finetuner import FineTuner\n\ndataset = load_dataset(''shibing624/nli_zh'', ''STS-B'')\n# 指定训练的模型为 m3e-small\nfinetuner = FineTuner.from_pretrained(''moka-ai/m3e-small'', dataset=dataset)\nfinetuner.run(epochs=1)\n```\n\n详见 [uniem 微调教程](https://github.com/wangyuxinwhy/uniem/blob/main/examples/finetune.ipynb)\n\n<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/wangyuxinwhy/uniem/blob/main/examples/finetune.ipynb">\n  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>\n</a>\n\n## ➿ 训练方案\n\nM3E 使用 in-batch 负采样的对比学习的方式在句对数据集进行训练，为了保证 in-batch 负采样的效果，我们使用 A100 80G 来最大化 batch-size，并在共计 2200W+ 的句对数据集上训练了 1 epoch。训练脚本使用 [uniem](https://github.com/wangyuxinwhy/uniem/blob/main/scripts/train_m3e.py)，您可以在这里查看具体细节。\n\n## 🌟 特性\n\n- 中文训练集，M3E 在大规模句对数据集上的训练，包含中文百科，金融，医疗，法律，新闻，学术等多个领域共计 2200W 句对样本，数据集详见 [M3E 数据集](#M3E数据集)\n- 英文训练集，M3E 使用 MEDI 145W 英文三元组数据集进行训练，数据集详见 [MEDI 数据集](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vZ5c2oJNonGOvXzppNg5mHz24O6jcc52/view)，此数据集由 [instructor team](https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding) 提供\n- 指令数据集，M3E 使用了 300W + 的指令微调数据集，这使得 M3E 对文本编码的时候可以遵从指令，这部分的工作主要被启发于 [instructor-embedding](https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding)\n- 基础模型，M3E 使用 hfl 实验室的 [Roberta](https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext) 系列模型进行训练，目前提供  small 和  base 两个版本，大家则需选用\n- ALL IN ONE，M3E 旨在提供一个 ALL IN ONE 的文本嵌入模型，不仅支持同质句子相似度判断，还支持异质文本检索，你只需要一个模型就可以覆盖全部的应用场景，未来还会支持代码检索\n\n## 💯 MTEB-zh 评测\n\n- 评测模型，[text2vec](https://github.com/shibing624/text2vec), m3e-base, m3e-small, openai text-embedding-ada-002, [DMetaSoul](https://huggingface.co/DMetaSoul/sbert-chinese-general-v2), [UER](https://huggingface.co/uer/sbert-base-chinese-nli), [ErLangShen](https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL/Erlangshen-SimCSE-110M-Chinese)\n- 评测脚本，具体参考 [MTEB-zh] (https://github.com/wangyuxinwhy/uniem/blob/main/mteb-zh)\n\n### 文本分类\n\n- 数据集选择，选择开源在 HuggingFace 上的 6 种文本分类数据集，包括新闻、电商评论、股票评论、长文本等\n- 评测方式，使用 MTEB 的方式进行评测，报告 Accuracy。\n\n|                   | text2vec | m3e-small | m3e-base | openai | DMetaSoul   | uer     | erlangshen  |\n| ----------------- |

费用有些高，所以我们只选择了 T2Ranking 中的前 10000 篇文章\n- 评测方式，使用 MTEB 的方式进行评测，报告 map@1, map@10, mrr@1, mrr@10, ndcg@1, ndcg@10\n- 注意！从实验结果和训练方式来看，除了 M3E 模型和 openai 模型外，其余模型都没有做检索任务的训练，所以结果仅供参考。\n\n|         |

0.39329    |\n\n#### T2Ranking\n\n- 数据集选择，使用 T2Ranking，刨除 openai-ada-002 模型后，我们对剩余的三个模型，进行 T2Ranking 10W 和 T2Ranking 50W 的评测。（T2Ranking 评测太耗内存了... 128G 都不行）\n- 评测方式，使用 MTEB 的方式进行评测，报告 ndcg@10\n\n|

| 0.33482  | 0.38626   | **0.47364**  |\n\n说明：\n- 检索排序对于 text2vec 并不公平，因为 text2vec 在训练的时候没有使用过检索相关的数据集，所以没有办法很好的完成检索任务也是正常的。\n\n## 📂 M3E数据集\n\n如果您想要使用这些数据集，你可以在 [uniem

It can generate videos more than ten times faster than the original AnimateDiff. For more information, please refer to our research paper: [AnimateDiff-Lightning: Cross-Model Diffusion Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12706). We release the model as part of the research.\n\nOur models are distilled from [AnimateDiff SD1.5 v2](https://huggingface.co/guoyww/animatediff). This repository contains checkpoints for 1-step, 2-step, 4-step, and 8-step distilled models. The generation quality of our 2-step, 4-step, and 8-step model is great. Our 1-step model is only provided for research purposes.\n\n\n## Demo\n\nTry AnimateDiff-Lightning using our text-to-video generation [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ByteDance/AnimateDiff-Lightning).\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nAnimateDiff-Lightning produces the best results when used with stylized base models. We recommend using the following base models:\n\nRealistic\n- [epiCRealism](https://civitai.com/models/25694)\n- [Realistic Vision](https://civitai.com/models/4201)\n- [DreamShaper](https://civitai.com/models/4384)\n- [AbsoluteReality](https://civitai.com/models/81458)\n- [MajicMix Realistic](https://civitai.com/models/43331)\n\nAnime & Cartoon\n- [ToonYou](https://civitai.com/models/30240)\n- [IMP](https://civitai.com/models/56680)\n- [Mistoon Anime](https://civitai.com/models/24149)\n- [DynaVision](https://civitai.com/models/75549)\n- [RCNZ Cartoon 3d](https://civitai.com/models/66347)\n- [MajicMix Reverie](https://civitai.com/models/65055)\n\nAdditionally, feel free to explore different settings. We find using 3 inference steps on the 2-step model produces great results. We find certain base models produces better results with CFG. We also recommend using [Motion LoRAs](https://huggingface.co/guoyww/animatediff/tree/main) as they produce stronger motion. We use Motion LoRAs with strength 0.7~0.8 to avoid watermark.\n\n## Diffusers Usage\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import AnimateDiffPipeline, MotionAdapter, EulerDiscreteScheduler\nfrom diffusers.utils import export_to_gif\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom safetensors.torch import load_file\n\ndevice = "cuda"\ndtype = torch.float16\n\nstep = 4  # Options: [1,2,4,8]\nrepo = "ByteDance/AnimateDiff-Lightning"\nckpt = f"animatediff_lightning_{step}step_diffusers.safetensors"\nbase = "emilianJR/epiCRealism"  # Choose to your favorite base model.\n\nadapter = MotionAdapter().to(device, dtype)\nadapter.load_state_dict(load_file(hf_hub_download(repo ,ckpt), device=device))\npipe = AnimateDiffPipeline.from_pretrained(base, motion_adapter=adapter, torch_dtype=dtype).to(device)\npipe.scheduler = EulerDiscreteScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config, timestep_spacing="trailing", beta_schedule="linear")\n\noutput = pipe(prompt="A girl smiling", guidance_scale=1.0, num_inference_steps=step)\nexport_to_gif(output.frames[0], "animation.gif")\n```\n\n## ComfyUI Usage\n\n1.

The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\n\nResources and Technical Documentation:\n\n+ [Phi-3 Microsoft Blog](https://aka.ms/Phi-3Build2024)\n+ [Phi-3 Technical Report](https://aka.ms/phi3-tech-report)\n+ [Phi-3 on Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/try-phi3vision)\n+ [Phi-3 Cookbook](https://github.com/microsoft/Phi-3CookBook)\n\n\n|         | Short Context | Long Context |\n| ------- | ------------- | ------------ |\n| Mini    | 4K [[HF]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct) ; [[ONNX]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx) ; [[GGUF]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf) | 128K [[HF]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct) ; [[ONNX]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct-onnx)|\n| Small   | 8K [[HF]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-small-8k-instruct) ; [[ONNX]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-small-8k-instruct-onnx-cuda) | 128K [[HF]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-small-128k-instruct) ; [[ONNX]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-small-128k-instruct-onnx-cuda)|\n| Medium  | 4K [[HF]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-medium-4k-instruct) ; [[ONNX]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-medium-4k-instruct-onnx-cuda) | 128K [[HF]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct) ; [[ONNX]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-onnx-cuda)|\n| Vision  |  | 128K [[HF]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct) ; [[ONNX]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct-onnx-cuda)|\n\n## Intended Uses\n\n**Primary use cases**\n\nThe model is intended for broad commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications with visual and text input capabilities which require \n\n1) memory/compute constrained environments;\n2) latency bound scenarios;\n3) general image understanding;\n4) OCR;\n5) chart and table understanding.\n\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on efficient language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features.\n\n**Use case considerations**\n\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. \nDevelopers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case. \n\nNothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.\n\n## How to Use\n\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.2) of `transformers`. Until the official version is released through `pip`, ensure that you are doing one of the following:\n* When loading the model, ensure that `trust_remote_code=True` is passed as an argument of the `from_pretrained()` function.\n\n* Update your local `transformers` to the development version: `pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers`. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.\n\nThe current `transformers` version can be verified with: `pip list | grep transformers`.\n\nExamples of required packages:\n```\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\n```\n\nPhi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is also available in [Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/phi3-azure-ai).\n\n### Chat Format\n\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct model is best suited for a single image input wih prompts using the chat format as follows. \nYou can provide the prompt as a single image with a generic template as follow:\n```markdown\n<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n \n```\n\nwhere the model generates the text after `<|assistant|>` . In case of multi-turn conversation, the prompt can be formatted as follows:\n\n```markdown\n<|user|>\n<|image_1|>\n{prompt_1}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n{response_1}<|end|>\n<|user|>\n{prompt_2}<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n \n```\n\n### Sample inference code\n\nThis code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport requests \nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM \nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor \n\nmodel_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct" \n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="cuda", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto", _attn_implementation=''flash_attention_2'') # use _attn_implementation=''eager'' to disable flash attention\n\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True) \n\nmessages = [ \n    {"role": "user", "content": "<|image_1|>\nWhat is shown in this image?"}, \n    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The chart displays the percentage of respondents who agree with various statements about their preparedness for meetings. It shows five categories: ''Having clear and pre-defined goals for meetings'', ''Knowing where to find the information I need for a meeting'', ''Understanding my exact role and responsibilities when I''m invited'', ''Having tools to manage admin tasks like note-taking or summarization'', and ''Having more focus time to sufficiently prepare for meetings''. Each category has an associated bar indicating the level of agreement, measured on a scale from 0% to 100%."}, \n    {"role": "user", "content": "Provide insightful questions to spark discussion."} \n] \n\nurl = "https://assets-c4akfrf5b4d3f4b7.z01.azurefd.net/assets/2024/04/BMDataViz_661fb89f3845e.png" \nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw) \n\nprompt = processor.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)\n\ninputs = processor(prompt, [image], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0") \n\ngeneration_args = { \n    "max_new_tokens": 500, \n    "temperature": 0.0, \n    "do_sample": False, \n} \n\ngenerate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id, **generation_args) \n\n# remove input tokens \ngenerate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs[''input_ids''].shape[1]:]\nresponse = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] \n\nprint(response) \n```\n\nAdditional basic examples are provided [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct/blob/main/sample_inference.py).\n\n### How to finetune?\nWe recommend user to take a look at the [Phi-3 CookBook finetuning recipe for Vision](https://github.com/microsoft/Phi-3CookBook/blob/main/md/04.Fine-tuning/FineTuning_Vision.md)\n\n\n## Responsible AI Considerations\n\nLike other models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:   \n\n+ Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.    \n+ Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases.  \n+ Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case.  \n+ Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.   \n+ Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.      \n\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include:  \n\n+ Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\n+ High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\n+ Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n+ Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\n+ Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\n+ Identification of individuals: models with vision capabilities may have the potential to uniquely identify individuals in images. Safety post-training steers the model to refuse such requests, but developers should consider and implement, as appropriate, additional mitigations or user consent flows as required in their respective jurisdiction, (e.g., building measures to blur faces in image inputs before processing.\n  \n## Training\n\n### Model\n\n* Architecture: Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct has 4.2B parameters and contains image encoder, connector, projector, and Phi-3 Mini language model.\n* Inputs: Text and Image. It’s best suited for prompts using the chat format. \n* Context length: 128K tokens\n* GPUs: 512 H100-80G\n* Training time: 1.5 days\n* Training data: 500B vision and text tokens\n* Outputs: Generated text in response to the input\n* Dates: Our models were trained between February and April 2024\n* Status: This is a static model trained on an offline text dataset with cutoff date Mar 15, 2024. Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.\n* Release Type: Open weight release\n* Release dates: The model weight is released on May 21, 2024.\n\n### Datasets\n\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, and is a combination of \n\n1) publicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data and code;\n2) selected high-quality image-text interleave;\n3) newly created synthetic, “textbook-like” data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.), newly created image data, e.g., chart/table/diagram/slides;\n4) high quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.\n\nThe data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a meticulous approach to filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, we carefully filtered various image and text data sources to remove or scrub any potentially personal data from the training data.\n \nMore details can be found in the [Phi-3 Technical Report](https://aka.ms/phi3-tech-report).\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nTo understand the capabilities, we compare Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct with a set of models over a variety of zero-shot benchmarks using our internal benchmark platform.\n\n|Benchmark|Phi-3 Vision-128K-In|LlaVA-1.6 Vicuna-7B|QWEN-VL Chat|Llama3-Llava-Next-8B|Claude-3 Haiku|Gemini 1.0 Pro V|GPT-4V-Turbo|\n|---------|---------------------|------------------|------------|--------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|\n|MMMU|40.4|34.2|39.0|36.4|40.7|42.0|55.5| \n|MMBench|80.5|76.3|75.8|79.4|62.4|80.0|86.1|\n|ScienceQA|90.8|70.6|67.2|73.7|72.0|79.7|75.7|\n|MathVista|44.5|31.5|29.4|34.8|33.2|35.0|47.5|\n|InterGPS|38.1|20.5|22.3|24.6|32.1|28.6|41.0|\n|AI2D|76.7|63.1|59.8|66.9|60.3|62.8|74.7|\n|ChartQA|81.4|55.0|50.9|65.8|59.3|58.0|62.3|\n|TextVQA|70.9|64.6|59.4|55.7|62.7|64.7|68.1|\n|POPE|85.8|87.2|82.6|87.0|74.4|84.2|83.7|\n\n\n## Software\n\n* [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)\n* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)\n* [Flash-Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention)\n\n## Hardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3-Vision-128K model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

ModernBERT leverages recent architectural improvements such as:\n\n- **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)** for long-context support.  \n- **Local-Global Alternating Attention** for efficiency on long inputs.  \n- **Unpadding and Flash Attention** for efficient inference.  \n\nModernBERT’s native long context length makes it ideal for tasks that require processing long documents, such as retrieval, classification, and semantic search within large corpora. The model was trained on a large corpus of text and code, making it suitable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including code retrieval and hybrid (text + code) semantic search.\n\nIt is available in the following sizes:\n\n- [ModernBERT-base](https://huggingface.co/answerdotai/ModernBERT-base) - 22 layers, 149 million parameters\n- [ModernBERT-large](https://huggingface.co/answerdotai/ModernBERT-large) - 28 layers, 395 million parameters\n\nFor more information about ModernBERT, we recommend our [release blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/modernbert) for a high-level overview, and our [arXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13663) for in-depth information.\n\n*ModernBERT is a collaboration between [Answer.AI](https://answer.ai), [LightOn](https://lighton.ai), and friends.*\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use these models directly with the `transformers` library starting from v4.48.0:\n\n```sh\npip install -U transformers>=4.48.0\n```\n\nSince ModernBERT is a Masked Language Model (MLM), you can use the `fill-mask` pipeline or load it via `AutoModelForMaskedLM`. To use ModernBERT for downstream tasks like classification, retrieval, or QA, fine-tune it following standard BERT fine-tuning recipes.\n\n**⚠️ If your GPU supports it, we recommend using ModernBERT with Flash Attention 2 to reach the highest efficiency. To do so, install Flash Attention as follows, then use the model as normal:**\n\n```bash\npip install flash-attn\n```\n\nUsing `AutoModelForMaskedLM`:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForMaskedLM\n\nmodel_id = "answerdotai/ModernBERT-base"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\ntext = "The capital of France is [MASK]."\ninputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# To get predictions for the mask:\nmasked_index = inputs["input_ids"][0].tolist().index(tokenizer.mask_token_id)\npredicted_token_id = outputs.logits[0, masked_index].argmax(axis=-1)\npredicted_token = tokenizer.decode(predicted_token_id)\nprint("Predicted token:", predicted_token)\n# Predicted token:  Paris\n```\n\nUsing a pipeline:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\npipe = pipeline(\n    "fill-mask",\n    model="answerdotai/ModernBERT-base",\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n)\n\ninput_text = "He walked to the [MASK]."\nresults = pipe(input_text)\npprint(results)\n```\n\n**Note:** ModernBERT does not use token type IDs, unlike some earlier BERT models. Most downstream usage is identical to standard BERT models on the Hugging Face Hub, except you can omit the `token_type_ids` parameter.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate ModernBERT across a range of tasks, including natural language understanding (GLUE), general retrieval (BEIR), long-context retrieval (MLDR), and code retrieval (CodeSearchNet and StackQA).\n\n**Key highlights:**\n- On GLUE, ModernBERT-base surpasses other similarly-sized encoder models, and ModernBERT-large is second only to Deberta-v3-large.\n- For general retrieval tasks, ModernBERT performs well on BEIR in both single-vector (DPR-style) and multi-vector (ColBERT-style) settings.\n- Thanks to the inclusion of code data in its training mixture, ModernBERT as a backbone also achieves new state-of-the-art code retrieval results on CodeSearchNet and StackQA.\n\n### Base Models\n\n| Model       | IR (DPR)     | IR (DPR)     | IR (DPR)     | IR (ColBERT)  | IR (ColBERT)  | NLU  | Code | Code |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------|------|------|\n|             | BEIR         | MLDR_OOD     | MLDR_ID      | BEIR          | MLDR_OOD      | GLUE | CSN  | SQA  |\n| BERT        | 38.9         | 23.9         | 32.2         | 49.0          | 28.1          | 84.7 | 41.2 | 59.5 |\n| RoBERTa     | 37.7         | 22.9         | 32.8         | 48.7          | 28.2          | 86.4 | 44.3 | 59.6 |\n| DeBERTaV3   | 20.2         | 5.4          | 13.4         | 47.1          | 21.9          | 88.1 | 17.5 | 18.6 |\n| NomicBERT   | 41.0         | 26.7         | 30.3         | 49.9          | 61.3          | 84.0 | 41.6 | 61.4 |\n| GTE-en-MLM  | 41.4         | **34.3**    |**44.4**   | 48.2          | 69.3          | 85.6 | 44.9 | 71.4 |\n| ModernBERT  | **41.6**    | 27.4         | 44.0         | **51.3**    | **80.2**      | **88.4** | **56.4** |**73.6**|\n\n---\n\n### Large Models\n\n| Model       | IR (DPR)     | IR (DPR)     | IR (DPR)     | IR (ColBERT)  | IR (ColBERT)  | NLU  | Code | Code |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------|------|------|\n|             | BEIR         | MLDR_OOD     | MLDR_ID      | BEIR          | MLDR_OOD      | GLUE | CSN  | SQA  |\n| BERT        | 38.9         | 23.3         | 31.7         | 49.5          | 28.5          | 85.2 | 41.6 | 60.8 |\n| RoBERTa     | 41.4         | 22.6         | 36.1         | 49.8          | 28.8          | 88.9 | 47.3 | 68.1 |\n| DeBERTaV3   | 25.6         | 7.1          | 19.2         | 46.7          | 23.0          | **91.4**| 21.2 | 19.7 |\n| GTE-en-MLM  | 42.5         | **36.4**    | **48.9**  | 50.7          | 71.3          | 87.6 | 40.5 | 66.9 |\n| ModernBERT  | **44.0**    | 34.3         | 48.6         | **52.4**     | **80.4**     | 90.4 |**59.5** |**83.9**|\n\n*Table 1: Results for all models across an overview of all tasks. CSN refers to CodeSearchNet and SQA to StackQA. MLDRID refers to in-domain (fine-tuned on the training set) evaluation, and MLDR_OOD to out-of-domain.*\n\nModernBERT’s strong results, coupled with its efficient runtime on long-context inputs, demonstrate that encoder-only models can be significantly improved through modern architectural choices and extensive pretraining on diversified data sources.\n\n\n## Limitations\n\nModernBERT’s training data is primarily English and code, so performance may be lower for other languages. While it can handle long sequences efficiently, using the full 8,192 tokens window may be slower than short-context inference. Like any large language model, ModernBERT may produce representations that reflect biases present in its training data. Verify critical or sensitive outputs before relying on them.\n\n## Training\n\n- Architecture: Encoder-only, Pre-Norm Transformer with GeGLU activations.\n- Sequence Length: Pre-trained up to 1,024 tokens, then extended to 8,192 tokens.\n- Data: 2 trillion tokens of English text and code.\n- Optimizer: StableAdamW with trapezoidal LR scheduling and 1-sqrt decay.\n- Hardware: Trained on 8x H100 GPUs.\n\nSee the paper for more details.\n\n## License\n\nWe release the ModernBERT model architectures, model weights, training codebase under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use ModernBERT in your work, please cite:\n\n```\n@misc{modernbert,\n      title={Smarter, Better, Faster, Longer: A Modern Bidirectional Encoder for Fast, Memory Efficient, and Long Context Finetuning and Inference}, \n      author={Benjamin Warner and Antoine Chaffin and Benjamin Clavié and Orion Weller and Oskar Hallström and Said Taghadouini and Alexis Gallagher and Raja Biswas and Faisal Ladhak and Tom Aarsen and Nathan Cooper and Griffin Adams and Jeremy Howard and Iacopo Poli},\n      year={2024},\n      eprint={2412.13663},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13663}, \n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"fill-mask","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":149655232,"storage_bytes":5084307056,"files_count":16,"spaces_count":64,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["ModernBertForMaskedLM"],"model_type":"modernbert","tokenizer_config":{"cls_token":"[CLS]","mask_token":"[MASK]","pad_token":"[PAD]","sep_token":"[SEP]","unk_token":"[UNK]"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2412.13663","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13663"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 64.8, '4c2898c4d434bfa01bb2712550a1cda9', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

However, they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive, thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nWe sincerely appreciate contributions from the research community to this project.

It can be used either in addition, or to replace text prompts.\n\nRevision also includes a blending function for combining multiple image or text concepts, as either positive or negative prompts.\n\n\n## Inference\n\nControl-LoRAs have been implemented into [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and [StableSwarmUI](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI)\n\nBasic ComfyUI workflows (using the base model only) are available in this HF repo.

Some users have reported that the process does not work on Windows. We recommend using WSL if you only have a Windows machine.**\n\nTo use OpenAssistant LLaMA-Based Models, you should have a copy of the original LLaMA model weights and add them to a `llama` subdirectory here. If you cannot obtain the original LLaMA, see the note in italic below for a possible alternative.\n\nEnsure your LLaMA 30B checkpoint matches the correct md5sums:\n\n```\nf856e9d99c30855d6ead4d00cc3a5573  consolidated.00.pth\nd9dbfbea61309dc1e087f5081e98331a  consolidated.01.pth\n2b2bed47912ceb828c0a37aac4b99073  consolidated.02.pth\nea0405cdb5bc638fee12de614f729ebc  consolidated.03.pth\n4babdbd05b8923226a9e9622492054b6  params.json\n```\n\n*If you do not have a copy of the original LLaMA weights and cannot obtain one, you may still be able to complete this process. Some users have reported that [this model](https://huggingface.co/elinas/llama-30b-hf-transformers-4.29) can be used as a base for the XOR conversion. This will also allow you to skip to Step 7. However, we only support conversion starting from LLaMA original checkpoint and cannot provide support if you experience issues with this alternative approach.*\n\n**Important: Follow these exact steps to convert your original LLaMA checkpoint to a HuggingFace Transformers-compatible format. If you use the wrong versions of any dependency, you risk ending up with weights which are not compatible with the XOR files.**\n\n1. Create a clean Python **3.10** virtual environment & activate it:\n\n```\npython3.10 -m venv xor_venv\nsource xor_venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n2. Clone transformers repo and switch to tested version:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\ncd transformers\ngit checkout d04ec99bec8a0b432fc03ed60cea9a1a20ebaf3c\npip install .\n```\n\n3. Install **exactly** these dependency versions:\n\n```\npip install torch==1.13.1 accelerate==0.18.0 sentencepiece==0.1.98 protobuf==3.20.1\n```\n\n4. Check `pip freeze` output:\n\n```\naccelerate==0.18.0\ncertifi==2022.12.7\ncharset-normalizer==3.1.0\nfilelock==3.12.0\nhuggingface-hub==0.13.4\nidna==3.4\nnumpy==1.24.2\nnvidia-cublas-cu11==11.10.3.66\nnvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu11==11.7.99\nnvidia-cuda-runtime-cu11==11.7.99\nnvidia-cudnn-cu11==8.5.0.96\npackaging==23.1\nprotobuf==3.20.1\npsutil==5.9.5\nPyYAML==6.0\nregex==2023.3.23\nrequests==2.28.2\nsentencepiece==0.1.98\ntokenizers==0.13.3\ntorch==1.13.1\ntqdm==4.65.0\ntransformers @ file:///mnt/data/koepf/transformers\ntyping_extensions==4.5.0\nurllib3==1.26.15\n```\n\n5.

If the checksums above do not match yours, there is a problem.**\n\n7. Once you have LLaMA weights in the correct format, you can apply the XOR decoding:\n\n```\npython xor_codec.py oasst-sft-6-llama-30b/ oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor/ llama30b_hf/\n```\n\nYou should **expect to see one warning message** during execution:\n\n`Exception when processing ''added_tokens.json''`\n\nThis is normal. **If similar messages appear for other files, something has gone wrong**.\n\n8. Now run `find . -type f -exec md5sum "{}" +` in the output directory (here `oasst-sft-6-llama-30b`). You should get a file with exactly these checksums:\n\n```\n970e99665d66ba3fad6fdf9b4910acc5  ./pytorch_model-00007-of-00007.bin\n659fcb7598dcd22e7d008189ecb2bb42  ./pytorch_model-00003-of-00007.bin\nff6e4cf43ddf02fb5d3960f850af1220  ./pytorch_model-00001-of-00007.bin\n27b0dc092f99aa2efaf467b2d8026c3f  ./added_tokens.json\n2917a1cafb895cf57e746cfd7696bfe5  ./generation_config.json\n740c324ae65b1ec25976643cda79e479  ./pytorch_model-00005-of-00007.bin\nf7aefb4c63be2ac512fd905b45295235  ./pytorch_model-00004-of-00007.bin\neeec4125e9c7560836b4873b6f8e3025  ./tokenizer.model\n369df2f0e38bda0d9629a12a77c10dfc  ./pytorch_model-00006-of-00007.bin\ncc9dbf56b68b68a585cc7367696e06a7  ./config.json\n76d47e4f51a8df1d703c6f594981fcab  ./pytorch_model.bin.index.json\nfd9452959d711be29ccf04a97598e8d1  ./tokenizer_config.json\n785905630a0fe583122a8446a5abe287  ./special_tokens_map.json\nae48c4c68e4e171d502dd0896aa19a84  ./pytorch_model-00002-of-00007.bin\n```\n\nIf so you have successfully decoded the weights and should be able to use the model with HuggingFace Transformers. **If your checksums do not match those above, there is a problem.**\n\n### Configuration\n\n```\nllama-30b-sft-6:\n  dtype: fp16\n  log_dir: "llama_log_30b"\n  learning_rate: 1e-5\n  model_name: /home/ubuntu/Open-Assistant/model/model_training/.saved/llama-30b-super-pretrain/checkpoint-3500\n  output_dir: llama_model_30b\n  deepspeed_config: configs/zero3_config_sft.json\n  weight_decay: 0.0\n  residual_dropout: 0.0\n  max_length: 2048\n  use_flash_attention: true\n  warmup_steps: 20\n  gradient_checkpointing: true\n  gradient_accumulation_steps: 16\n  per_device_train_batch_size: 2\n  per_device_eval_batch_size: 3\n  eval_steps: 101\n  save_steps: 292\n  num_train_epochs: 8\n  save_total_limit: 3\n  use_custom_sampler: true\n  sort_by_length: false\n  save_strategy: steps\n  datasets:\n    - oasst_export:\n        lang: "bg,ca,cs,da,de,en,es,fr,hr,hu,it,nl,pl,pt,ro,ru,sl,sr,sv,uk"\n        input_file_path: 2023-04-12_oasst_release_ready_synth.jsonl.gz\n        val_split: 0.05\n    - vicuna:\n        val_split: 0.05\n        max_val_set: 800\n        fraction: 0.8\n    - dolly15k:\n        val_split: 0.05\n        max_val_set: 300\n    - grade_school_math_instructions:\n        val_split: 0.05\n    - code_alpaca:\n        val_split: 0.05\n        max_val_set: 250\n```\n\n- **OASST dataset paper:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07327', '{"pipeline_tag":null,"library_name":null,"framework":null,"params":null,"storage_bytes":65059086164,"files_count":17,"spaces_count":20,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":null}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers.git","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2304.07327","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07327"}]', NULL, 'Other', 'approved', 64.7, '6149fc4070a7fe3d8c35fda6fcc69ebf', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Introduction\n\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\n\n**NOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the [Usage Recommendation](#usage-recommendations) section.**\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="80%" src="figures/benchmark.jpg">\n</p>\n\n## 2. Model Summary\n\n---\n\n**Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model**\n\n-  We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\n\n-   We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model''s reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\n    We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models. \n\n---\n\n**Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too**\n\n-  We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \n- Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\n## 3.

How to Run Locally\n\n### DeepSeek-R1 Models\n\nPlease visit [DeepSeek-V3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\n\n**NOTE: Hugging Face''s Transformers has not been directly supported yet.**\n\n### DeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\n\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm):\n\n```shell\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\n```\n\nYou can also easily start a service using [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)\n\n```bash\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n```\n\n### Usage Recommendations\n\n**We recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:**\n\n1. Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\n2. **Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.**\n3. For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."\n4. When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\n\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting "\<think\>\n\n\</think\>") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model''s performance.\n**To ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with "\<think\>\n" at the beginning of every output.**\n\n## 7.

Possible research areas and\ntasks include\n\n- Safe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.\n- Probing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.\n- Generation of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.\n- Applications in educational or creative tools.\n- Research on generative models.\n\nExcluded uses are described below.\n\n ### Misuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use\n_Note: This section is taken from the [DALLE-MINI model card](https://huggingface.co/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), but applies in the same way to Stable Diffusion v1_.\n\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.\n\n#### Out-of-Scope Use\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n#### Misuse and Malicious Use\nUsing the model to generate content that is cruel to individuals is a misuse of this model. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Generating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc.\n- Intentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes.\n- Impersonating individuals without their consent.\n- Sexual content without consent of the people who might see it.\n- Mis- and disinformation\n- Representations of egregious violence and gore\n- Sharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n- Sharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n\n## Limitations and Bias\n\n### Limitations\n\n- The model does not achieve perfect photorealism\n- The model cannot render legible text\n- The model does not perform well on more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to “A red cube on top of a blue sphere”\n- Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.\n- The model was trained mainly with English captions and will not work as well in other languages.\n- The autoencoding part of the model is lossy\n- The model was trained on a large-scale dataset\n  [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) which contains adult material\n  and is not fit for product use without additional safety mechanisms and\n  considerations.\n- No additional measures were used to deduplicate the dataset. As a result, we observe some degree of memorization for images that are duplicated in the training data.\n  The training data can be searched at [https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/](https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/) to possibly assist in the detection of memorized images.\n\n### Bias\n\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. \nStable Diffusion v1 was trained on subsets of [LAION-2B(en)](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), \nwhich consists of images that are primarily limited to English descriptions. \nTexts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. \nThis affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the \nability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.\n\n### Safety Module\n\nThe intended use of this model is with the [Safety Checker](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/safety_checker.py) in Diffusers. \nThis checker works by checking model outputs against known hard-coded NSFW concepts.\nThe concepts are intentionally hidden to reduce the likelihood of reverse-engineering this filter.\nSpecifically, the checker compares the class probability of harmful concepts in the embedding space of the `CLIPTextModel` *after generation* of the images. \nThe concepts are passed into the model with the generated image and compared to a hand-engineered weight for each NSFW concept.\n\n\n## Training\n\n**Training Data**\nThe model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\n\n- LAION-2B (en) and subsets thereof (see next section)\n\n**Training Procedure**\nStable Diffusion v1-5 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training, \n\n- Images are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\n- Text prompts are encoded through a ViT-L/14 text-encoder.\n- The non-pooled output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\n- The loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet.\n\nCurrently six Stable Diffusion checkpoints are provided, which were trained as follows.\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-1`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-1): 237,000 steps at resolution `256x256` on [laion2B-en](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-en).\n  194,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on [laion-high-resolution](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion-high-resolution) (170M examples from LAION-5B with resolution `>= 1024x1024`).\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-2`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-2): Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-1`.\n  515,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on "laion-improved-aesthetics" (a subset of laion2B-en,\nfiltered to images with an original size `>= 512x512`, estimated aesthetics score `> 5.0`, and an estimated watermark probability `< 0.5`. The watermark estimate is from the LAION-5B metadata, the aesthetics score is estimated using an [improved aesthetics estimator](https://github.com/christophschuhmann/improved-aesthetic-predictor)).\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-3`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-3): Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-2` - 195,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on "laion-improved-aesthetics" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-4`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-2` - 225,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on "laion-aesthetics v2 5+" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-5`](https://huggingface.co/sd-legacy/stable-diffusion-v1-5) Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-2` - 595,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on "laion-aesthetics v2 5+" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).\n- [`stable-diffusion-inpainting`](https://huggingface.co/sd-legacy/stable-diffusion-inpainting) Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-5` - then 440,000 steps of inpainting training at resolution 512x512 on “laion-aesthetics v2 5+” and 10% dropping of the text-conditioning. For inpainting, the UNet has 5 additional input channels (4 for the encoded masked-image and 1 for the mask itself) whose weights were zero-initialized after restoring the non-inpainting checkpoint. During training, we generate synthetic masks and in 25% mask everything.\n\n- **Hardware:** 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs\n- **Optimizer:** AdamW\n- **Gradient Accumulations**: 2\n- **Batch:** 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048\n- **Learning rate:** warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant\n\n## Evaluation Results \nEvaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,\n5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 PNDM/PLMS sampling\nsteps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:\n\n![pareto](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion/resolve/main/v1-1-to-v1-5.png)\n\nEvaluated using 50 PLMS steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.

The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family and supports 128K token context length. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.\n\n🏡 [Phi-3 Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/phi-3) <br>\n📰 [Phi-3 Microsoft Blog](https://aka.ms/phi3.5-techblog) <br>\n📖 [Phi-3 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219) <br>\n👩‍🍳 [Phi-3 Cookbook](https://github.com/microsoft/Phi-3CookBook) <br>\n🖥️ [Try It](https://aka.ms/try-phi3.5mini) <br>\n\n**Phi-3.5**: [[mini-instruct](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) | [onnx](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-onnx)]; [[MoE-instruct]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct); [[vision-instruct]](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct)\n\n## Intended Uses\n\n### Primary Use Cases\n\nThe model is intended for commercial and research use in multiple languages. The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications which require:\n\n1) Memory/compute constrained environments\n2) Latency bound scenarios\n3) Strong reasoning (especially code, math and logic)\n\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features. \n\n### Use Case Considerations\n\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fariness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high risk scenarios. Developers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case.\n\n***Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.*** \n\n## Release Notes \n\nThis is an update over the June 2024 instruction-tuned Phi-3 Mini release based on valuable user feedback. The model used additional post-training data leading to substantial gains on multilingual, multi-turn conversation quality, and reasoning capability. We believe most use cases will benefit from this release, but we encourage users to test in their particular AI applications. We appreciate the enthusiastic adoption of the Phi-3 model family, and continue to welcome all feedback from the community.\n\n### Multilingual\n\nThe table below highlights multilingual capability of the Phi-3.5 Mini on multilingual MMLU, MEGA, and multilingual MMLU-pro datasets. Overall, we observed that even with just 3.8B active parameters, the model is  competitive on multilingual tasks in comparison to other models with a much bigger active parameters.  \n\n| Benchmark                  | Phi-3.5 Mini-Ins | Phi-3.0-Mini-128k-Instruct (June2024) | Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 | Mistral-Nemo-12B-Ins-2407 | Llama-3.1-8B-Ins | Gemma-2-9B-Ins | Gemini 1.5 Flash | GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18 (Chat) |\n|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Multilingual MMLU          | 55.4             | 51.08                 | 47.4                     | 58.9                      | 56.2             | 63.8           | 77.2             | 72.9                          |\n| Multilingual MMLU-Pro      | 30.9             | 30.21                 | 15.0                     | 34.0                      | 21.4             | 43.0           | 57.9             | 53.2                          |\n| MGSM                       | 47.9             | 41.56                 | 31.8                     | 63.3                      | 56.7             | 75.1           | 75.8             | 81.7                          |\n| MEGA MLQA                  | 61.7             | 55.5                  | 43.9                     | 61.2                      | 45.2             | 54.4           | 61.6             | 70.0                          |\n| MEGA TyDi QA               | 62.2             | 55.9                  | 54.0                     | 63.7                      | 54.5             | 65.6           | 63.6             | 81.8                          |\n| MEGA UDPOS                 | 46.5             | 48.1                  | 57.2                     | 58.2                      | 54.1             | 56.6           | 62.4             | 66.0                          |\n| MEGA XCOPA                 | 63.1             | 62.4                  | 58.8                     | 10.8                      | 21.1             | 31.2           | 95.0             | 90.3                          |\n| MEGA XStoryCloze           | 73.5             | 73.6                  | 75.5                     | 92.3                      | 71.0             | 87.0           | 20.7             | 96.6                          |\n| **Average** | **55.2** | **52.3** | **47.9** | **55.3** | **47.5** | **59.6** | **64.3** | **76.6** |\n\nThe table below shows Multilingual MMLU scores in some of the supported languages.

We see that Phi-3.5-mini is clearly better than Gemma-2 family which only supports 8K context length. Phi-3.5-mini is competitive with other much larger open-weight models such as Llama-3.1-8B-instruct, Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3, and Mistral-Nemo-12B-instruct-2407.\n\n| Benchmark | Phi-3.5-mini-instruct | Llama-3.1-8B-instruct | Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3 | Mistral-Nemo-12B-instruct-2407 | Gemini-1.5-Flash | GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18 (Chat) |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n| GovReport | 25.9 | 25.1 | 26.0 | 25.6 | 27.8 | 24.8 |\n| QMSum | 21.3 | 21.6 | 21.3 | 22.1 | 24.0 | 21.7 |\n| Qasper | 41.9 | 37.2 | 31.4 | 30.7 | 43.5 | 39.8 |\n| SQuALITY | 25.3 | 26.2 | 25.9 | 25.8 | 23.5 | 23.8 |\n| SummScreenFD | 16.0 | 17.6 | 17.5 | 18.2 | 16.3 | 17.0 |\n| **Average** | **26.1** | **25.5** | **24.4** | **24.5** | **27.0** | **25.4** |\n\nRULER: a retrieval-based benchmark for long context understanding\n| Model | 4K | 8K | 16K | 32K | 64K | 128K | Average |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n| **Phi-3.5-mini-instruct** | 94.3 | 91.1 | 90.7 | 87.1 | 78.0 | 63.6 | **84.1** |\n| **Llama-3.1-8B-instruct** | 95.5 | 93.8 | 91.6 | 87.4 | 84.7 | 77.0 | **88.3** |\n| **Mistral-Nemo-12B-instruct-2407** | 87.8 | 87.2 | 87.7 | 69.0 | 46.8 | 19.0 | **66.2** |\n\nRepoQA: a benchmark for long context code understanding\n| Model | Python | C++ | Rust | Java | TypeScript | Average |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n| **Phi-3.5-mini-instruct** | 86 | 67 | 73 | 77 | 82 | **77** |\n| **Llama-3.1-8B-instruct** | 80 | 65 | 73 | 76 | 63 | **71** |\n| **Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3** | 61 | 57 | 51 | 61 | 80 | **62** |\n\n## Usage\n\n### Requirements\nPhi-3 family has been integrated in the `4.43.0` version of `transformers`. The current `transformers` version can be verified with: `pip list | grep transformers`.\n\nExamples of required packages:\n```\nflash_attn==2.5.8\ntorch==2.3.1\naccelerate==0.31.0\ntransformers==4.43.0\n```\n\nPhi-3.5-mini-instruct is also available in [Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/try-phi3.5mini)\n\n### Tokenizer\n\nPhi-3.5-mini-Instruct supports a vocabulary size of up to `32064` tokens. The [tokenizer files](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct/blob/main/added_tokens.json) already provide placeholder tokens that can be used for downstream fine-tuning, but they can also be extended up to the model''s vocabulary size.\n\n### Input Formats\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3.5-mini-instruct model is best suited for prompts using the chat format as follows:\n\n```\n<|system|>\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|end|>\n<|user|>\nHow to explain Internet for a medieval knight?<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n```\n\n### Loading the model locally\nAfter obtaining the Phi-3.5-mini-instruct model checkpoint, users can use this sample code for inference.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline\n\ntorch.random.manual_seed(0)\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    "microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct", \n    device_map="cuda", \n    torch_dtype="auto", \n    trust_remote_code=True, \n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct")\n\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},\n    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you provide ways to eat combinations of bananas and dragonfruits?"},\n    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are some ways to eat bananas and dragonfruits together: 1. Banana and dragonfruit smoothie: Blend bananas and dragonfruits together with some milk and honey. 2. Banana and dragonfruit salad: Mix sliced bananas and dragonfruits together with some lemon juice and honey."},\n    {"role": "user", "content": "What about solving an 2x + 3 = 7 equation?"},\n]\n\npipe = pipeline(\n    "text-generation",\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n)\n\ngeneration_args = {\n    "max_new_tokens": 500,\n    "return_full_text": False,\n    "temperature": 0.0,\n    "do_sample": False,\n}\n\noutput = pipe(messages, **generation_args)\nprint(output[0][''generated_text''])\n```\n\nNotes: If you want to use flash attention, call _AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained()_ with _attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"_\n\n## Responsible AI Considerations\n\nLike other language models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:  \n+ Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text and some additional multilingual text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance as well as performance disparities across non-English. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.   \n+ Multilingual performance and safety gaps: We believe it is important to make language models more widely available across different languages, but the Phi 3 models still exhibit challenges common across multilingual releases. As with any deployment of LLMs, developers will be better positioned to test for performance or safety gaps for their linguistic and cultural context and customize the model with additional fine-tuning and appropriate safeguards.\n+ Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups, cultural contexts, or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \n+ Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the case. \n+ Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.  \n+ Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\n+ Long Conversation: Phi-3 models, like other models, can in some cases generate responses that are repetitive, unhelpful, or inconsistent in very long chat sessions in both English and non-English languages. Developers are encouraged to place appropriate mitigations, like limiting conversation turns to account for the possible conversational drift\n\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices, including mapping, measuring, and mitigating risks associated with their specific use case and cultural, linguistic context. Phi-3 family of models are general purpose models. As developers plan to deploy these models for specific use cases, they are encouraged to fine-tune the models for their use case and leverage the models as part of broader AI systems with language-specific safeguards in place. Important areas for consideration include:  \n\n+ Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\n+ High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess the suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context. \n+ Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).   \n+ Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case. \n+ Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Training\n\n### Model\n\n**Architecture:** Phi-3.5-mini has 3.8B parameters and is a dense decoder-only Transformer model using the same tokenizer as Phi-3 Mini.<br>\n**Inputs:** Text. It is best suited for prompts using chat format.<br>\n**Context length:** 128K tokens<br>\n**GPUs:** 512 H100-80G<br>\n**Training time:** 10 days<br>\n**Training data:** 3.4T tokens<br>\n**Outputs:** Generated text in response to the input<br>\n**Dates:** Trained between June and August 2024<br>\n**Status:** This is a static model trained on an offline dataset with cutoff date October 2023 for publicly available data. Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.<br>\n**Supported languages:** Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian<br>\n**Release date:** August 2024<br>\n\n### Training Datasets\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, totaling 3.4 trillion tokens, and is a combination of \n1) publicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data, and code;\n2) newly created synthetic, “textbook-like” data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.);\n3) high quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness. \n\nWe are focusing on the quality of data that could potentially improve the reasoning ability for the model, and we filter the publicly available documents to contain the correct level of knowledge. As an example, the result of a game in premier league in a particular day might be good training data for frontier models, but we need to remove such information to leave more model capacity for reasoning for the small size models. More details about data can be found in the [Phi-3 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14219).\n\n### Fine-tuning\n\nA basic example of multi-GPUs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with TRL and Accelerate modules is provided [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct/resolve/main/sample_finetune.py).\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nWe report the results under completion format for Phi-3.5-mini on standard open-source benchmarks measuring the model''s reasoning ability (both common sense reasoning and logical reasoning).

These numbers might differ from other published numbers due to slightly different choices in the evaluation.\n\nAs is now standard, we use few-shot prompts to evaluate the models, at temperature 0. \nThe prompts and number of shots are part of a Microsoft internal tool to evaluate language models, and in particular we did no optimization to the pipeline for Phi-3.\nMore specifically, we do not change prompts, pick different few-shot examples, change prompt format, or do any other form of optimization for the model.\n\nThe number of k–shot examples is listed per-benchmark.

Findings across the various evaluation methods indicate that safety \npost-training that was done as detailed in the [Phi-3 Safety Post-Training paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13833) had a positive impact across multiple languages and risk categories as observed by \nrefusal rates (refusal to output undesirable outputs) and robustness to jailbreak techniques. Note, however, while comprehensive red team evaluations were conducted \nacross all models in the prior release of Phi models, red teaming was largely focused on Phi-3.5 MOE across multiple languages and risk categories for this release as \nit is the largest and more capable model of the three models. Details on prior red team evaluations across Phi models can be found in the [Phi-3 Safety Post-Training paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13833). \nFor this release, insights from red teaming indicate that the models may refuse to generate undesirable outputs in English, even when the request for undesirable output \nis in another language. Models may also be more susceptible to longer multi-turn jailbreak techniques across both English and non-English languages. These findings \nhighlight the need for industry-wide investment in the development of high-quality safety evaluation datasets across multiple languages, including low resource languages, \nand risk areas that account for cultural nuances where those languages are spoken.\n\n\n## Software\n* [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)\n* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)\n* [Flash-Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention)\n\n## Hardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3.5-mini-instruct model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run.

For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2:\n\n- Significantly **more knowledge** and has greatly improved capabilities in **coding** and **mathematics**, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains.\n- Significant improvements in **instruction following**, **generating long texts** (over 8K tokens), **understanding structured data** (e.g, tables), and **generating structured outputs** especially JSON. **More resilient to the diversity of system prompts**, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.\n- **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.\n- **Multilingual support** for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. \n\n**This repo contains the instruction-tuned 7B Qwen2.5 model**, which has the following features:\n- Type: Causal Language Models\n- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\n- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias\n- Number of Parameters: 7.61B\n- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B\n- Number of Layers: 28\n- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV\n- Context Length: Full 131,072 tokens and generation 8192 tokens\n  - Please refer to [this section](#processing-long-texts) for detailed instructions on how to deploy Qwen2.5 for handling long texts.\n\nFor more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen2''\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\nHere provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nprompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant."},\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=512\n)\ngenerated_ids = [\n    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n]\n\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n```\n\n### Processing Long Texts\n\nThe current `config.json` is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.\nTo handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.\n\nFor supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:\n```json\n{\n  ...,\n  "rope_scaling": {\n    "factor": 4.0,\n    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768,\n    "type": "yarn"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor deployment, we recommend using vLLM. \nPlease refer to our [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html) for usage if you are not familar with vLLM.\nPresently, vLLM only supports static YARN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts**. \nWe advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required.\n\n## Evaluation & Performance\n\nDetailed evaluation results are reported in this [📑 blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/).\n\nFor requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen2.5,\n    title = {Qwen2.5: A Party of Foundation Models},\n    url = {https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/},\n    author = {Qwen Team},\n    month = {September},\n    year = {2024}\n}\n\n@article{qwen2,\n      title={Qwen2 Technical Report}, \n      author={An Yang and Baosong Yang and Binyuan Hui and Bo Zheng and Bowen Yu and Chang Zhou and Chengpeng Li and Chengyuan Li and Dayiheng Liu and Fei Huang and Guanting Dong and Haoran Wei and Huan Lin and Jialong Tang and Jialin Wang and Jian Yang and Jianhong Tu and Jianwei Zhang and Jianxin Ma and Jin Xu and Jingren Zhou and Jinze Bai and Jinzheng He and Junyang Lin and Kai Dang and Keming Lu and Keqin Chen and Kexin Yang and Mei Li and Mingfeng Xue and Na Ni and Pei Zhang and Peng Wang and Ru Peng and Rui Men and Ruize Gao and Runji Lin and Shijie Wang and Shuai Bai and Sinan Tan and Tianhang Zhu and Tianhao Li and Tianyu Liu and Wenbin Ge and Xiaodong Deng and Xiaohuan Zhou and Xingzhang Ren and Xinyu Zhang and Xipin Wei and Xuancheng Ren and Yang Fan and Yang Yao and Yichang Zhang and Yu Wan and Yunfei Chu and Yuqiong Liu and Zeyu Cui and Zhenru Zhang and Zhihao Fan},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.10671},\n      year={2024}\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":7615616512,"storage_bytes":15231271888,"files_count":14,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Qwen2ForCausalLM"],"model_type":"qwen2","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":null,"chat_template":"{%- if tools %}\n    {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' }}\n    {%- if messages[0][''role''] == ''system'' %}\n        {{- messages[0][''content''] }}\n    {%- else %}\n        {{- ''You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

It''s been trained on question-answer pairs, including unanswerable questions, for the task of Extractive Question Answering. \nWe have also released a distilled version of this model called [deepset/tinyroberta-squad2](https://huggingface.co/deepset/tinyroberta-squad2). It has a comparable prediction quality and runs at twice the speed of [deepset/roberta-base-squad2](https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2).\n\n\n## Overview\n**Language model:** roberta-base  \n**Language:** English  \n**Downstream-task:** Extractive QA  \n**Training data:** SQuAD 2.0  \n**Eval data:** SQuAD 2.0  \n**Code:**  See [an example extractive QA pipeline built with Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/34_extractive_qa_pipeline)  \n**Infrastructure**: 4x Tesla v100\n\n## Hyperparameters\n\n```\nbatch_size = 96\nn_epochs = 2\nbase_LM_model = "roberta-base"\nmax_seq_len = 386\nlearning_rate = 3e-5\nlr_schedule = LinearWarmup\nwarmup_proportion = 0.2\ndoc_stride=128\nmax_query_length=64\n``` \n\n## Usage\n\n### In Haystack\nHaystack is an AI orchestration framework to build customizable, production-ready LLM applications. You can use this model in Haystack to do extractive question answering on documents. \nTo load and run the model with [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/):\n```python\n# After running pip install haystack-ai "transformers[torch,sentencepiece]"\n\nfrom haystack import Document\nfrom haystack.components.readers import ExtractiveReader\n\ndocs = [\n    Document(content="Python is a popular programming language"),\n    Document(content="python ist eine beliebte Programmiersprache"),\n]\n\nreader = ExtractiveReader(model="deepset/roberta-base-squad2")\nreader.warm_up()\n\nquestion = "What is a popular programming language?"\nresult = reader.run(query=question, documents=docs)\n# {''answers'': [ExtractedAnswer(query=''What is a popular programming language?'', score=0.5740374326705933, data=''python'', document=Document(id=..., content: ''...''), context=None, document_offset=ExtractedAnswer.Span(start=0, end=6),...)]}\n```\nFor a complete example with an extractive question answering pipeline that scales over many documents, check out the [corresponding Haystack tutorial](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/34_extractive_qa_pipeline).\n\n### In Transformers\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoTokenizer, pipeline\n\nmodel_name = "deepset/roberta-base-squad2"\n\n# a) Get predictions\nnlp = pipeline(''question-answering'', model=model_name, tokenizer=model_name)\nQA_input = {\n    ''question'': ''Why is model conversion important?'',\n    ''context'': ''The option to convert models between FARM and transformers gives freedom to the user and let people easily switch between frameworks.''\n}\nres = nlp(QA_input)\n\n# b) Load model & tokenizer\nmodel = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n```\n\n## Performance\nEvaluated on the SQuAD 2.0 dev set with the [official eval script](https://worksheets.codalab.org/rest/bundles/0x6b567e1cf2e041ec80d7098f031c5c9e/contents/blob/).\n\n```\n"exact": 79.87029394424324,\n"f1": 82.91251169582613,\n\n"total":

Steps to get started:\n\n1. First install the 🤗 [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from main and [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece):\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git sentencepiece\n```\n\n2. Run the following Python code to generate speech samples. Here the target language is Russian:\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, SeamlessM4Tv2Model\nimport torchaudio\n\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/seamless-m4t-v2-large")\nmodel = SeamlessM4Tv2Model.from_pretrained("facebook/seamless-m4t-v2-large")\n\n# from text\ntext_inputs = processor(text = "Hello, my dog is cute", src_lang="eng", return_tensors="pt")\naudio_array_from_text = model.generate(**text_inputs, tgt_lang="rus")[0].cpu().numpy().squeeze()\n\n# from audio\naudio, orig_freq =  torchaudio.load("https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~i101/SoundFiles/preamble10.wav")\naudio =  torchaudio.functional.resample(audio, orig_freq=orig_freq, new_freq=16_000) # must be a 16 kHz waveform array\naudio_inputs = processor(audios=audio, return_tensors="pt")\naudio_array_from_audio = model.generate(**audio_inputs, tgt_lang="rus")[0].cpu().numpy().squeeze()\n```\n\n3. Listen to the audio samples either in an ipynb notebook:\n\n```py\nfrom IPython.display import Audio\n\nsample_rate = model.config.sampling_rate\nAudio(audio_array_from_text, rate=sample_rate)\n# Audio(audio_array_from_audio, rate=sample_rate)\n```\n\nOr save them as a `.wav` file using a third-party library, e.g. `scipy`:\n\n```py\nimport scipy\n\nsample_rate = model.config.sampling_rate\nscipy.io.wavfile.write("out_from_text.wav", rate=sample_rate, data=audio_array_from_text)\n# scipy.io.wavfile.write("out_from_audio.wav", rate=sample_rate, data=audio_array_from_audio)\n```\nFor more details on using the SeamlessM4T model for inference using the 🤗 Transformers library, refer to the \n**[SeamlessM4T v2 docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/seamless_m4t_v2)** or to this **hands-on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ylacombe/scripts_and_notebooks/blob/main/v2_seamless_m4t_hugging_face.ipynb).**\n\n\n## Supported Languages:\n\nListed below, are the languages supported by SeamlessM4T-large (v1/v2).\nThe `source` column specifies whether a language is supported as source speech (`Sp`) and/or source text (`Tx`).\nThe `target` column specifies whether a language is supported as target speech (`Sp`) and/or target text (`Tx`).\n\n\n| code | language               | script     | Source | Target |\n| ---- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ------ |

To experience the latest model, please visit [Qwen Chat](https://qwen.ai)  and select the "Image Editing" feature.\nCompared with Qwen-Image-Edit released in August, the main improvements of Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 include:\n* **Multi-image Editing Support**: For multi-image inputs, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 builds upon the Qwen-Image-Edit architecture and is further trained via image concatenation to enable multi-image editing. It supports various combinations such as "person + person," "person + product," and "person + scene." Optimal performance is currently achieved with 1 to 3 input images.\n* **Enhanced Single-image Consistency**: For single-image inputs, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 significantly improves editing consistency, specifically in the following areas:\n  - **Improved Person Editing Consistency**: Better preservation of facial identity, supporting various portrait styles and pose transformations;\n  - **Improved Product Editing Consistency**: Better preservation of product identity, supporting product poster editing；\n  - **Improved Text Editing Consistency**: In addition to modifying text content, it also supports editing text fonts, colors, and materials；\n* **Native Support for ControlNet**: Including depth maps, edge maps, keypoint maps, and more.\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\nInstall the latest version of diffusers\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use `Qwen-Image-Edit-2509`:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom diffusers import QwenImageEditPlusPipeline\n\npipeline = QwenImageEditPlusPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)\nprint("pipeline loaded")\n\npipeline.to(''cuda'')\npipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)\nimage1 = Image.open("input1.png")\nimage2 = Image.open("input2.png")\nprompt = "The magician bear is on the left, the alchemist bear is on the right, facing each other in the central park square."\ninputs = {\n    "image": [image1, image2],\n    "prompt": prompt,\n    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),\n    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,\n    "negative_prompt": " ",\n    "num_inference_steps": 40,\n    "guidance_scale": 1.0,\n    "num_images_per_prompt": 1,\n}\nwith torch.inference_mode():\n    output = pipeline(**inputs)\n    output_image = output.images[0]\n    output_image.save("output_image_edit_plus.png")\n    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit_plus.png"))\n\n```\n\n## Showcase\n\n**The primary update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is support for multi-image inputs.**\n\nLet’s first look at a "person + person" example:  \n![Person + Person Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8719.JPG#center)\n\nHere is a "person + scene" example:  \n![Person + Scene Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8720.JPG#center)\n\nBelow is a "person + object" example:  \n![Person + Object Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8721.JPG#center)\n\nIn fact, multi-image input also supports commonly used ControlNet keypoint maps—for example, changing a person’s pose:  \n![ControlNet Keypoint Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8722.JPG#center)\n\nSimilarly, the following examples demonstrate results using three input images:  \n![Three Images Example 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8723.JPG#center)  \n![Three Images Example 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8724.JPG#center)  \n![Three Images Example 3](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8725.JPG#center)\n\n---\n\n**Another major update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is enhanced consistency.**\n\nFirst, regarding person consistency, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 shows significant improvement over Qwen-Image-Edit. Below are examples generating various portrait styles:  \n![Portrait Styles Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.JPG#center)\n\nFor instance, changing a person’s pose while maintaining excellent identity consistency:  \n![Pose Change with Identity Consistency](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.JPG#center)\n\nLeveraging this improvement along with Qwen-Image’s unique text rendering capability, we find that Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 excels at creating meme images:  \n![Meme Image Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.JPG#center)\n\nOf course, even with longer text, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 can still render it while preserving the person’s identity:  \n![Long Text with Identity Preservation](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.JPG#center)\n\nPerson consistency is also evident in old photo restoration. Below are two examples:  \n![Old Photo Restoration 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8717.JPG#center)  \n![Old Photo Restoration 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8718.JPG#center)\n\nNaturally, besides real people, generating cartoon characters and cultural creations is also possible:  \n![Cartoon & Cultural Creation](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8715.JPG#center)\n\nSecond, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances product consistency. We find that the model can naturally generate product posters from plain-background product images:  \n![Product Poster Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.JPG#center)\n\nOr even simple logos:  \n![Logo Generation Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8716.JPG#center)\n\nThird, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances text consistency and supports editing font type, font color, and font material:  \n![Text Font Type](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.JPG#center)  \n![Text Font Color](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.JPG#center)  \n![Text Font Material](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.JPG#center)\n\nMoreover, the ability for precise text editing has been significantly enhanced:  \n![Precise Text Editing 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.JPG#center)  \n![Precise Text Editing 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.JPG#center)\n\nIt is worth noting that text editing can often be seamlessly integrated with image editing—for example, in this poster editing case:  \n![Integrated Text & Image Editing](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.JPG#center)\n\n---\n\n**The final update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is native support for commonly used ControlNet image conditions, such as keypoint control and sketches:**  \n![Keypoint Control Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.JPG#center)  \n![Sketch Control Example 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.JPG#center)  \n![Sketch Control Example 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.JPG#center)\n\n\n\n## License Agreement\n\nQwen-Image is licensed under Apache 2.0. \n\n## Citation\n\nWe kindly encourage citation of our work if you find it useful.\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{wu2025qwenimagetechnicalreport,\n      title={Qwen-Image Technical Report}, \n      author={Chenfei Wu and Jiahao Li and Jingren Zhou and Junyang Lin and Kaiyuan Gao and Kun Yan and Sheng-ming Yin and Shuai Bai and Xiao Xu and Yilei Chen and Yuxiang Chen and Zecheng Tang and Zekai Zhang and Zhengyi Wang and An Yang and Bowen Yu and Chen Cheng and Dayiheng Liu and Deqing Li and Hang Zhang and Hao Meng and Hu Wei and Jingyuan Ni and Kai Chen and Kuan Cao and Liang Peng and Lin Qu and Minggang Wu and Peng Wang and Shuting Yu and Tingkun Wen and Wensen Feng and Xiaoxiao Xu and Yi Wang and Yichang Zhang and Yongqiang Zhu and Yujia Wu and Yuxuan Cai and Zenan Liu},\n      year={2025},\n      eprint={2508.02324},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CV},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02324}, \n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"image-to-image","library_name":"diffusers","framework":"diffusers","params":null,"storage_bytes":57711227846,"files_count":35,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"diffusers":{"_class_name":"QwenImageEditPlusPipeline"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:QwenLM:Qwen-Image","source_url":"https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:QwenLM:Qwen-Image\">Github<","source_url":"https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image\">Github<"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:diffusers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2508.02324","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02324"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 79.7, '1c0497ccf9ed70531f6b522328ab1fed', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

There are many workarounds, but I prefer just fixing the node and I''ve supplied my version in the Files area. It also supports up to 4 input images. Just set the "target_size" to a little less than your output''s largest size (like 896 if making a 1024x1024 image). I find this improves quality over skipping scaling entirely, as input images better match output resolutions.\n\n![image](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/631be8402ea8535ea48abbc6/ynDNK35eRLlUjha75fYHH.png)\n\n**V1:** Uses Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 & 4-step Lightning v2.0. Includes a touch of NSFW LORAs, so it should be a very versatile model for both SFW and NSFW use. sa_solver/beta recommended, but euler_a/beta and er_sde/beta can give decent results too.\n\n**V2:** Now uses a mix of Qwen-Image-Edit accelerators, mixing both 8 and 4 steps in one. Also significantly tweaked the NSFW LORAs for better all-around SFW and NSFW use. sa_solver/simple strongly recommended.\n\n**V3:** Uses new Qwen-Image-Edit lightning LORAs for much better results. Also significantly adjusted NSFW LORA mix, removing poor ones and increasing quality ones. sa_solver/beta highly recommended.\n\n**V4:** Mix of many Qwen Edit and base Qwen accelerators, which I think gives better results. Added a touch of a skin correction LORA. **4-5 steps: use sa_solver/simple, lcm/beta or euler_a/beta** and **6-8 steps: use lcm/beta or euler_a/beta only**.\n\n**V5:** NSFW and SFW use cases interfered with eachother too much, so I separated them to specialize in their use cases. Updated "snofs" and "qwen4play" NSFW LORAs + Meta4 for v5.2, then added "Qwen Image NSFW Adv." by fok3827 for v5.3. **SFW: lcm/beta or er_sde/beta generally recommended** and **NSFW: lcm/normal recommended**. Prompting "Professional digital photography" helps reduce the plastic look.\n\n**V6:** Attempt at valiantcat/Qwen-Image-Edit-MeiTu and partially chestnutlzj/Edit-R1-Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 as a base model. However, this was a broken merge. It appears using them as LORAs may work better and I need to cook some more to find something useable. Stay on v5 until something newer comes out.\n\n**V7:** valiantcat/Qwen-Image-Edit-MeiTu and chestnutlzj/Edit-R1-Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 included as LORAs. Accelerator and NSFW LORAs tweaks (v7.1 is more NSFW-heavy). This seemed to be working much better. **lcm/sgm_uniform recommended for 4-6 steps, lcm/normal for 7-8 steps**.\n\n**V8:** Using BF16 to load in FP32 LORAs, only to scale down to FP8 for saving. This seems to help resolve "grid" issues and improves quality. Tweaked accelerator amounts. Significant NSFW LORA tweaks (and new SNOFS). **euler_a/beta recommended for 4-6 steps, lcm/normal for 7-8 steps**.\n\n**V9:** OK, I lied. "Rebalancing" and "Smartphone Photoreal" LORAs really do help image generations for both SFW and NSFW purposes. If you don''t want those LORAs integrated (like making anime or cartoons), use the "Lite" versions. Also, I had a typo in accelerators in V8 that has been fixed for V9. Tweaked NSFW LORAs and significantly reduced how heavy they need to be applied, which should hopefully help consistency. **euler_a/beta recommended for 4-6 steps**. More steps usually work better with sgm_normal or normal schedulers.\n\n**V10:** This is kinda a mix of v5 and v9. MeiTu and Edit-R1 dropped. I''m keeping the "Rebalancing" and "Smartphone" LORAs at half strengths which I think help skin, variety and composition. NSFW LORAs closely resemble v5.3 (but with updated v1.2 snofs). v10.4 NSFW tweaked to improve character consistency and penises. **euler/beta strongly recommended for 4-8 steps** but **euler_a/sgm_uniform recommended for NSFW v10.2+**.\n\n**V11:** Tweaked NSFW LORAs, using fewer to rely on more compatible ones instead. Spread out "realism" LORAs to more at lower strength. **euler/beta recommended** for both NSFW and SFW, but feel free to experiment with others!\n\n**V12:** Getting inpatient waiting for Qwen Edit 2511 (2512?), so went looking for more LORAs and tweaks to reduce the "plastic" look. **euler/sgm_uniform for SFW** and **er_sde/sgm_uniform for NSFW**, although experimentation is healthy is this context.\n\n**V13:** Tweaks to included LORAs in an attempt to reduce gridlines and increase character consistency (without returning the plastic look). **er_sde/beta recommended**. \n\n**V14:** Trimmed LORAs which may have been interfereing with character consistency (while hopefully still reducing the "plastic" look). Updated new SNOFS v1.3 for NSFW and trimmed poor NSFW LORAs too. **er_sde/beta recommended**.

It was introduced in the paper [End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872) by Carion et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing DETR did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe DETR model is an encoder-decoder transformer with a convolutional backbone. Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. \n\nThe model is trained using a "bipartite matching loss": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a "no object" as class and "no bounding box" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.\n\n![model image](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/detr_architecture.png)\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for object detection. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/detr) to look for all available DETR models.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DetrImageProcessor, DetrForObjectDetection\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\nurl = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\n# you can specify the revision tag if you don''t want the timm dependency\nprocessor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50", revision="no_timm")\nmodel = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50", revision="no_timm")\n\ninputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits) to COCO API\n# let''s only keep detections with score > 0.9\ntarget_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])\nresults = processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes, threshold=0.9)[0]\n\nfor score, label, box in zip(results["scores"], results["labels"], results["boxes"]):\n    box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]\n    print(\n            f"Detected {model.config.id2label[label.item()]} with confidence "\n            f"{round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}"\n    )\n```\nThis should output:\n```\nDetected remote with confidence 0.998 at location [40.16, 70.81, 175.55, 117.98]\nDetected remote with confidence 0.996 at location [333.24, 72.55, 368.33, 187.66]\nDetected couch with confidence 0.995 at location [-0.02, 1.15, 639.73, 473.76]\nDetected cat with confidence 0.999 at location [13.24, 52.05, 314.02, 470.93]\nDetected cat with confidence 0.999 at location [345.4, 23.85, 640.37, 368.72]\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model support PyTorch. \n\n## Training data\n\nThe DETR model was trained on [COCO 2017 object detection](https://cocodataset.org/#download), a dataset consisting of 118k/5k annotated images for training/validation respectively. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/master/vit_jax/input_pipeline.py). \n\nImages are resized/rescaled such that the shortest side is at least 800 pixels and the largest side at most 1333 pixels, and normalized across the RGB channels with the ImageNet mean (0.485, 0.456, 0.406) and standard deviation (0.229, 0.224, 0.225).\n\n### Training\n\nThe model was trained for 300 epochs on 16 V100 GPUs. This takes 3 days, with 4 images per GPU (hence a total batch size of 64).\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nThis model achieves an AP (average precision) of **42.0** on COCO 2017 validation. For more details regarding evaluation results, we refer to table 1 of the original paper.\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2005-12872,\n  author    = {Nicolas Carion and\n               Francisco Massa and\n               Gabriel Synnaeve and\n               Nicolas Usunier and\n               Alexander Kirillov and\n               Sergey Zagoruyko},\n  title     = {End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/2005.12872},\n  year      = {2020},\n  url       = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {2005.12872},\n  timestamp = {Thu, 28 May 2020 17:38:09 +0200},\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2005-12872.bib},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"object-detection","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":41631008,"storage_bytes":835779962,"files_count":6,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["DetrForObjectDetection"],"model_type":"detr"}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:facebookresearch:detr","source_url":"https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:vision_transformer","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2005.12872","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 64.6, '613c2d0fe7ded51198fc5b385baeeed7', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

It was introduced in the paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) by Dosovitskiy et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer). However, the weights were converted from the [timm repository](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) by Ross Wightman, who already converted the weights from JAX to PyTorch. Credits go to him. \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing ViT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) pretrained on a large collection of images in a supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. Next, the model was fine-tuned on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, also at resolution 224x224.\n\nImages are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.\n\nBy pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=google/vit) to look for\nfine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to classify an image of the COCO 2017 dataset into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import ViTImageProcessor, ViTForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\nurl = ''http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg''\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nprocessor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained(''google/vit-base-patch16-224'')\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained(''google/vit-base-patch16-224'')\n\ninputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\n# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nprint("Predicted class:", model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx])\n```\n\nFor more code examples, we refer to the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/vit.html#).\n\n## Training data\n\nThe ViT model was pretrained on [ImageNet-21k](http://www.image-net.org/), a dataset consisting of 14 million images and 21k classes, and fine-tuned on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/), a dataset consisting of 1 million images and 1k classes. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/master/vit_jax/input_pipeline.py). \n\nImages are resized/rescaled to the same resolution (224x224) and normalized across the RGB channels with mean (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and standard deviation (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on TPUv3 hardware (8 cores). All model variants are trained with a batch size of 4096 and learning rate warmup of 10k steps. For ImageNet, the authors found it beneficial to additionally apply gradient clipping at global norm 1. Training resolution is 224.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nFor evaluation results on several image classification benchmarks, we refer to tables 2 and 5 of the original paper. Note that for fine-tuning, the best results are obtained with a higher resolution (384x384). Of course, increasing the model size will result in better performance.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{wu2020visual,\n      title={Visual Transformers: Token-based Image Representation and Processing for Computer Vision}, \n      author={Bichen Wu and Chenfeng Xu and Xiaoliang Dai and Alvin Wan and Peizhao Zhang and Zhicheng Yan and Masayoshi Tomizuka and Joseph Gonzalez and Kurt Keutzer and Peter Vajda},\n      year={2020},\n      eprint={2006.03677},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CV}\n}\n```\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{deng2009imagenet,\n  title={Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database},\n  author={Deng, Jia and Dong, Wei and Socher, Richard and Li, Li-Jia and Li, Kai and Fei-Fei, Li},\n  booktitle={2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={248--255},\n  year={2009},\n  organization={Ieee}\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"image-classification","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":86567656,"storage_bytes":2550907501,"files_count":8,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["ViTForImageClassification"],"model_type":"vit"}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:vision_transformer","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:rwightman:pytorch-image-models","source_url":"https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:vision_transformer","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2010.11929","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2006.03677","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03677"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 64.6, '6479738f3ef95b2bddd34bdc67913366', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

As an intermediate step toward our next-generation architecture, V3.2-Exp builds upon V3.1-Terminus by introducing DeepSeek Sparse Attention—a sparse attention mechanism designed to explore and validate optimizations for training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios.\n\nThis experimental release represents our ongoing research into more efficient transformer architectures, particularly focusing on improving computational efficiency when processing extended text sequences.\n\n<div align="center">\n <img src="assets/cost.png" >\n</div>\n\n- DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) achieves fine-grained sparse attention for the first time, delivering substantial improvements in long-context training and inference efficiency while maintaining virtually identical model output quality.\n\n\n- To rigorously evaluate the impact of introducing sparse attention, we deliberately aligned the training configurations of DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp with V3.1-Terminus. Across public benchmarks in various domains, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp demonstrates performance on par with V3.1-Terminus.\n\n\n| Benchmark | DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus | DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **Reasoning Mode w/o Tool Use** | | |\n| MMLU-Pro | 85.0 | 85.0 |\n| GPQA-Diamond | 80.7 | 79.9 |\n| Humanity''s Last Exam | 21.7 | 19.8 |\n| LiveCodeBench | 74.9 | 74.1 |\n| AIME 2025 | 88.4 | 89.3 |\n| HMMT 2025 | 86.1 | 83.6 |\n| Codeforces | 2046 | 2121 |\n| Aider-Polyglot | 76.1 | 74.5 |\n| **Agentic Tool Use** | | |\n| BrowseComp | 38.5 | 40.1 |\n| BrowseComp-zh | 45.0 | 47.9 |\n| SimpleQA | 96.8 | 97.1 |\n| SWE Verified | 68.4 | 67.8 |\n| SWE-bench Multilingual | 57.8 | 57.9 |\n| Terminal-bench | 36.7 | 37.7 |\n\n## Update\n\n- 2025.11.17: **We have identified that previous versions of the inference demo code contained an implementation discrepancy in Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) within the indexer module, potentially leading to degraded model performance.** Specifically, the input tensor to RoPE in the indexer module requires a non-interleaved layout, whereas RoPE in the MLA module expects an interleaved layout. This issue has now been resolved. Please refer to the updated version of the inference demo code and take note of this implementation detail.\n\n## How to Run Locally\n\n### HuggingFace\n\nWe provide an updated inference demo code in the [inference](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp/tree/main/inference) folder to help the community quickly get started with our model and understand its architectural details.\n\nFirst convert huggingface model weights to the the format required by our inference demo. Set `MP` to match your available GPU count:\n```bash\ncd inference\nexport EXPERTS=256\npython convert.py --hf-ckpt-path ${HF_CKPT_PATH} --save-path ${SAVE_PATH} --n-experts ${EXPERTS} --model-parallel ${MP}\n```\n\nLaunch the interactive chat interface and start exploring DeepSeek''s capabilities:\n```bash\nexport CONFIG=config_671B_v3.2.json\ntorchrun --nproc-per-node ${MP} generate.py --ckpt-path ${SAVE_PATH} --config ${CONFIG} --interactive\n```\n\n### SGLang\n\n#### Installation with Docker\n\n```\n# H200\ndocker pull lmsysorg/sglang:dsv32\n\n# MI350\ndocker pull lmsysorg/sglang:dsv32-rocm\n\n# NPUs\ndocker pull lmsysorg/sglang:dsv32-a2\ndocker pull lmsysorg/sglang:dsv32-a3\n```\n\n#### Launch Command\n```bash\npython -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp --tp 8 --dp 8 --enable-dp-attention\n```\n\n### vLLM\n\nvLLM provides day-0 support of DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp.

pursuit of more powerful and agentic artificial intelligence (AI). \nWe are excited to share our latest advancements in addressing these demands, centered on improving scaling efficiency through innovative model architecture. \nWe call this next-generation foundation models **Qwen3-Next**.\n\n## Highlights\n\n**Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B** is the first installment in the Qwen3-Next series and features the following key enchancements:\n- **Hybrid Attention**: Replaces standard attention with the combination of **Gated DeltaNet** and **Gated Attention**, enabling efficient context modeling for ultra-long context length.\n- **High-Sparsity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: Achieves an extreme low activation ratio in MoE layers, drastically reducing FLOPs per token while preserving model capacity. \n- **Stability Optimizations**: Includes techniques such as **zero-centered and weight-decayed layernorm**, and other stabilizing enhancements for robust pre-training and post-training.  \n- **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)**: Boosts pretraining model performance and accelerates inference.\n\nWe are seeing strong performance in terms of both parameter efficiency and inference speed for Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B:\n- Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Base outperforms Qwen3-32B-Base on downstream tasks with 10% of the total training cost and with 10 times inference throughput for context over 32K tokens.\n- Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct performs on par with Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 on certain benchmarks, while demonstrating significant advantages in handling ultra-long-context tasks up to 256K tokens.\n\n![Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct Benchmark Comparison](https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-Next/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct.001.jpeg)\n\nFor more details, please refer to our

Qwen3-Next has been merged into the main branch of Hugging Face `transformers`.\n\n```shell\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@main\n```\n\nWith earlier versions, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen3_next''\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto",\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt},\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=16384,\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\nprint("content:", content)\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) is not generally available in Hugging Face Transformers.\n\n> [!Note]\n> The efficiency or throughput improvement depends highly on the implementation.\n> It is recommended to adopt a dedicated inference framework, e.g., SGLang and vLLM, for inference tasks.\n\n> [!Tip]\n> Depending on the inference settings, you may observe better efficiency with [`flash-linear-attention`](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention#installation) and [`causal-conv1d`](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/causal-conv1d).\n> See the links for detailed instructions and requirements.\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nFor deployment, you can use the latest `sglang` or `vllm` to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.\n\n### SGLang\n\n[SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) is a fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models.\nSGLang could be used to launch a server with OpenAI-compatible API service. \n\n`sglang>=0.5.2` is required for Qwen3-Next, which can be installed using:\n```shell\npip install ''sglang[all]>=0.5.2''\n```\nSee [its documentation](https://docs.sglang.ai/get_started/install.html) for more details.\n\nThe following command can be used to create an API endpoint at `http://localhost:30000/v1` with maximum context length 256K tokens using tensor parallel on 4 GPUs.\n```shell\npython -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 30000 --tp-size 4 --context-length 262144 --mem-fraction-static 0.8\n```\n\nThe following command is recommended for MTP with the rest settings the same as above:\n```shell\npython -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 30000 --tp-size 4 --context-length 262144 --mem-fraction-static 0.8 --speculative-algo NEXTN --speculative-num-steps 3 --speculative-eagle-topk 1 --speculative-num-draft-tokens 4\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> The default context length is 256K. Consider reducing the context length to a smaller value, e.g., `32768`, if the server fails to start.\n\nPlease also refer to SGLang''s usage guide on [Qwen3-Next](https://docs.sglang.ai/basic_usage/qwen3.html).\n\n### vLLM\n\n[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs.\nvLLM could be used to launch a server with OpenAI-compatible API service. \n\n`vllm>=0.10.2` is required for Qwen3-Next, which can be installed using:\n```shell\npip install ''vllm>=0.10.2''\n```\nSee [its documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/index.html) for more details.\n\nThe following command can be used to create an API endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/v1` with maximum context length 256K tokens using tensor parallel on 4 GPUs.\n```shell\nvllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 8000 --tensor-parallel-size 4 --max-model-len 262144\n```\n\nThe following command is recommended for MTP with the rest settings the same as above:\n```shell\nvllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 8000 --tensor-parallel-size 4 --max-model-len 262144 --speculative-config ''{"method":"qwen3_next_mtp","num_speculative_tokens":2}''\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> The default context length is 256K. Consider reducing the context length to a smaller value, e.g., `32768`, if the server fails to start.\n\nPlease also refer to vLLM''s usage guide on [Qwen3-Next](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/recipes/en/latest/Qwen/Qwen3-Next.html).\n\n## Agentic Use\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n```python\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n    ''model'': ''Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct'',\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    ''model_server'': ''http://localhost:8000/v1'',  # api_base\n    ''api_key'': ''EMPTY'',\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {''mcpServers'': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            ''time'': {\n                ''command'': ''uvx'',\n                ''args'': [''mcp-server-time'', ''--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai'']\n            },\n            "fetch": {\n                "command": "uvx",\n                "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  ''code_interpreter'',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{''role'': ''user'', ''content'': ''https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen''}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n\n## Processing Ultra-Long Texts\n\nQwen3-Next natively supports context lengths of up to 262,144 tokens. \nFor conversations where the total length (including both input and output) significantly exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively. \nWe have validated the model''s performance on context lengths of up to 1 million tokens using the [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071) method.\n\nYaRN is currently supported by several inference frameworks, e.g., `transformers`, `vllm` and `sglang`. \nIn general, there are two approaches to enabling YaRN for supported frameworks:\n\n- Modifying the model files:\n  In the `config.json` file, add the `rope_scaling` fields:\n    ```json\n    {\n        ...,\n        "rope_scaling": {\n            "rope_type": "yarn",\n            "factor": 4.0,\n            "original_max_position_embeddings": 262144\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n- Passing command line arguments:\n\n  For `vllm`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN=1 vllm serve ... --rope-scaling ''{"rope_type":"yarn","factor":4.0,"original_max_position_embeddings":262144}'' --max-model-len 1010000  \n    ```\n\n  For `sglang`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    SGLANG_ALLOW_OVERWRITE_LONGER_CONTEXT_LEN=1 python -m sglang.launch_server ... --json-model-override-args ''{"rope_scaling":{"rope_type":"yarn","factor":4.0,"original_max_position_embeddings":262144}}'' --context-length 1010000\n    ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> All the notable open-source frameworks implement static YaRN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.**\n> We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required. \n> It is also recommended to modify the `factor` as needed. For example, if the typical context length for your application is 524,288 tokens, it would be better to set `factor` as 2.0. \n\n#### Long-Context Performance\n\nWe test the model on an 1M version of the [RULER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06654) benchmark.\n\n| Model Name                                  | Acc avg | 4k   | 8k   | 16k  | 32k  | 64k  | 96k  | 128k | 192k | 256k | 384k | 512k | 640k | 768k | 896k | 1000k |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|\n| Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507                 | 86.8    | 98.0 | 96.7 | 96.9 | 97.2 | 93.4 | 91.0 | 89.1 | 89.8 | 82.5 | 83.6 | 78.4 | 79.7 | 77.6 | 75.7 | 72.8  |\n| Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507               | 92.5    | 98.5 | 97.6 | 96.9 | 97.3 | 95.8 | 94.9 | 93.9 | 94.5 | 91.0 | 92.2 | 90.9 | 87.8 | 84.8 | 86.5 | 84.5  |\n| Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct                 | 91.8    | 98.5 | 99.0 | 98.0 | 98.7 | 97.6 | 95.0 | 96.0 | 94.0 | 93.5 | 91.7 | 86.9 | 85.5 | 81.7 | 80.3 | 80.3  |\n\n* Qwen3-Next are evaluated with YaRN enabled. Qwen3-2507 models are evaluated with Dual Chunk Attention enabled.\n* Since the evaluation is time-consuming, we use 260 samples for each length (13 sub-tasks, 20 samples for each).\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - We suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 16,384 tokens for most queries, which is adequate for instruct models.\n\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n   - **Math Problems**: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `"answer": "C"`."\n\n### Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\n      title={Qwen3 Technical Report}, \n      author={Qwen Team},\n      year={2025},\n      eprint={2505.09388},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388}, \n}\n\n@article{qwen2.5-1m,\n      title={Qwen2.5-1M Technical Report}, \n      author={An Yang and Bowen Yu and Chengyuan Li and Dayiheng Liu and Fei Huang and Haoyan Huang and Jiandong Jiang and Jianhong Tu and Jianwei Zhang and Jingren Zhou and Junyang Lin and Kai Dang and Kexin Yang and Le Yu and Mei Li and Minmin Sun and Qin Zhu and Rui Men and Tao He and Weijia Xu and Wenbiao Yin and Wenyuan Yu and Xiafei Qiu and Xingzhang Ren and Xinlong Yang and Yong Li and Zhiying Xu and Zipeng Zhang},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2501.15383},\n      year={2025}\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":81324862720,"storage_bytes":162670584182,"files_count":51,"spaces_count":40,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Qwen3NextForCausalLM"],"model_type":"qwen3_next","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":null,"chat_template":"{%- if tools %}\n    {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' }}\n    {%- if messages[0].role == ''system'' %}\n        {{- messages[0].content + ''\\n\\n'' }}\n    {%- endif %}\n    {{- \"# Tools\\n\\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\\n\\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\\n<tools>\" }}\n    {%- for tool in tools %}\n        {{- \"\\n\" }}\n        {{- tool | tojson }}\n    {%- endfor %}\n    {{- \"\\n</tools>\\n\\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\\n<tool_call>\\n{\\\"name\\\": <function-name>, \\\"arguments\\\": <args-json-object>}\\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\\n\" }}\n{%- else %}\n    {%- if messages[0].role == ''system'' %}\n        {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' + messages[0].content + ''<|im_end|>\\n'' }}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endif %}\n{%- for message in messages %}\n    {%- if message.content is string %}\n        {%- set content = message.content %}\n    {%- else %}\n        {%- set content = '''' %}\n    {%- endif %}\n    {%- if (message.role == \"user\") or (message.role == \"system\" and not loop.first) %}\n        {{- ''<|im_start|>'' + message.role + ''\\n'' + content + ''<|im_end|>'' + ''\\n'' }}\n    {%- elif message.role == \"assistant\" %}\n        {{- ''<|im_start|>'' + message.role + ''\\n'' + content }}\n        {%- if message.tool_calls %}\n            {%- for tool_call in message.tool_calls %}\n                {%- if (loop.first and content) or (not loop.first) %}\n                    {{- ''\\n'' }}\n                {%- endif %}\n                {%- if tool_call.function %}\n                    {%- set tool_call = tool_call.function %}\n                {%- endif %}\n                {{- ''<tool_call>\\n{\"name\": \"'' }}\n                {{- tool_call.name }}\n                {{- ''\", \"arguments\": '' }}\n                {%- if tool_call.arguments is string %}\n                    {{- tool_call.arguments }}\n                {%- else %}\n                    {{- tool_call.arguments | tojson }}\n                {%- endif %}\n                {{- ''}\\n</tool_call>'' }}\n            {%- endfor %}\n        {%- endif %}\n        {{- ''<|im_end|>\\n'' }}\n    {%- elif message.role == \"tool\" %}\n        {%- if loop.first or (messages[loop.index0 -

Unlike Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, which require detailed descriptions of potential function arguments—sometimes needing up to tens of thousands of input tokens—Octopus-V2-2B introduces a unique **functional token** strategy for both its training and inference stages. This approach not only allows it to achieve performance levels comparable to GPT-4 but also significantly enhances its inference speed beyond that of RAG-based methods, making it especially beneficial for edge computing devices.\n\n📱 **On-device Applications**:  Octopus-V2-2B is engineered to operate seamlessly on Android devices, extending its utility across a wide range of applications, from Android system management to the orchestration of multiple devices. \n\n🚀 **Inference Speed**: When benchmarked, Octopus-V2-2B demonstrates a remarkable inference speed, outperforming the combination of "Llama7B + RAG solution" by a factor of 36X on a single A100 GPU. Furthermore, compared to GPT-4-turbo (gpt-4-0125-preview), which relies on clusters A100/H100 GPUs, Octopus-V2-2B is 168% faster. This efficiency is attributed to our **functional token** design.\n\n🐙 **Accuracy**: Octopus-V2-2B not only excels in speed but also in accuracy, surpassing the "Llama7B + RAG solution" in function call accuracy by 31%. It achieves a function call accuracy comparable to GPT-4 and RAG + GPT-3.5, with scores ranging between 98% and 100% across benchmark datasets.\n\n💪 **Function Calling Capabilities**: Octopus-V2-2B is capable of generating individual, nested, and parallel function calls across a variety of complex scenarios.\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\n\n<p align="center" width="100%">\n<a><img src="tool-usage-compressed.png" alt="ondevice" style="width: 80%; min-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>\n</p>\n\nYou can run the model on a GPU using the following code. \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, GemmaForCausalLM\nimport torch\nimport time\n\ndef inference(input_text):\n    start_time = time.time()\n    input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n    input_length = input_ids["input_ids"].shape[1]\n    outputs = model.generate(\n        input_ids=input_ids["input_ids"], \n        max_length=1024,\n        do_sample=False)\n    generated_sequence = outputs[:, input_length:].tolist()\n    res = tokenizer.decode(generated_sequence[0])\n    end_time = time.time()\n    return {"output": res, "latency": end_time - start_time}\n\nmodel_id = "NexaAIDev/Octopus-v2"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = GemmaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_id, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto"\n)\n\ninput_text = "Take a selfie for me with front camera"\nnexa_query = f"Below is the query from the users, please call the correct function and generate the parameters to call the function.\n\nQuery: {input_text} \n\nResponse:"\nstart_time = time.time()\nprint("nexa model result:\n", inference(nexa_query))\nprint("latency:", time.time() - start_time," s")\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe benchmark result can be viewed in [this excel](android_benchmark.xlsx), which has been manually verified. Microsoft''s Phi-3 model achieved an accuracy of 45.7%, with an average inference latency of 10.2 seconds. Meanwhile, Apple''s OpenELM was unable to generate a function call, as shown in [this screenshot](https://huggingface.co/NexaAIDev/Octopus-v2/blob/main/OpenELM-benchmark.jpeg). Additionally, OpenELM''s score on the MMLU benchmark is quite low at 26.7, compared to Google''s Gemma 2B, which scored 42.3.\n\n<p align="center" width="100%">\n<a><img src="latency_plot.jpg" alt="ondevice" style="width: 80%; min-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;"></a>\n<a><img src="accuracy_plot.jpg" alt="ondevice" style="width: 80%; min-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>\n</p>\n\n**Note**: One can notice that the query includes all necessary parameters used for a function. It is expected that query includes all parameters during inference as well.\n\n## Training Data\nWe wrote 20 Android API descriptions to used to train the models, see [this file](android_functions.txt) for details. The Android API implementations for our demos, and our training data will be published later. Below is one Android API description example\n```\ndef get_trending_news(category=None, region=''US'', language=''en'', max_results=5):\n    """\n    Fetches trending news articles based on category, region, and language.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - category (str, optional): News category to filter by, by default use None for all categories. Optional to provide.\n    - region (str, optional): ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for region-specific news, by default, uses ''US''. Optional to provide.\n    - language (str, optional): ISO 639-1 language code for article language, by default uses ''en''. Optional to provide.\n    - max_results (int, optional): Maximum number of articles to return, by default, uses 5. Optional to provide.\n\n    Returns:\n    - list[str]: A list of strings, each representing an article. Each string contains the article''s heading and URL.\n    """\n```\n\n\n## License\nThis model was trained on commercially viable data.

We outline the following hyperparameters:\n\n| Dataset           | Batch Size | Learning Rate |Learning Rate Decay| Warm-up | Weight Decay | Betas       |\n|-------------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|\n| Orca pt1 packed   | 256        | 3e-5          | Cosine to 3e-6    | 100     | 1e-6         | (0.9, 0.95) |\n| Orca pt2 unpacked | 512        | 3e-5          | Cosine to 3e-6    | 100     | 1e-6         | (0.9, 0.95) |\n\n## Ethical Considerations and Limitations\n\nBeluga is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Beluga''s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Beluga, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\n\n## How to cite\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{StableBelugaModels, \n      url={[https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/StableBeluga2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/StableBeluga2)}, \n      title={Stable Beluga models}, \n      author={Mahan, Dakota and Carlow, Ryan and Castricato, Louis and Cooper, Nathan and Laforte, Christian}\n}\n```\n\n## Citations\n\n```bibtext\n@misc{touvron2023llama,\n      title={Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models}, \n      author={Hugo Touvron and Louis Martin and Kevin Stone and Peter Albert and Amjad Almahairi and Yasmine Babaei and Nikolay Bashlykov and Soumya Batra and Prajjwal Bhargava and Shruti Bhosale and Dan Bikel and Lukas Blecher and Cristian Canton Ferrer and Moya Chen and Guillem Cucurull and David Esiobu and Jude Fernandes and Jeremy Fu and Wenyin Fu and Brian Fuller and Cynthia Gao and Vedanuj Goswami and Naman Goyal and Anthony Hartshorn and Saghar Hosseini and Rui Hou and Hakan Inan and Marcin Kardas and Viktor Kerkez and Madian Khabsa and Isabel Kloumann and Artem Korenev and Punit Singh Koura and Marie-Anne Lachaux and Thibaut Lavril and Jenya Lee and Diana Liskovich and Yinghai Lu and Yuning Mao and Xavier Martinet and Todor Mihaylov and Pushkar Mishra and Igor Molybog and Yixin Nie and Andrew Poulton and Jeremy Reizenstein and Rashi Rungta and Kalyan Saladi and Alan Schelten and Ruan Silva and Eric Michael Smith and Ranjan Subramanian and Xiaoqing Ellen Tan and Binh Tang and Ross Taylor and Adina Williams and Jian Xiang Kuan and Puxin Xu and Zheng Yan and Iliyan Zarov and Yuchen Zhang and Angela Fan and Melanie Kambadur and Sharan Narang and Aurelien Rodriguez and Robert Stojnic and Sergey Edunov and Thomas Scialom},\n      year={2023},\n      eprint={2307.09288},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}\n```\n\n```bibtext\n@misc{mukherjee2023orca,\n      title={Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4}, \n      author={Subhabrata Mukherjee and Arindam Mitra and Ganesh Jawahar and Sahaj Agarwal and Hamid Palangi and Ahmed Awadallah},\n      year={2023},\n      eprint={2306.02707},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}\n```\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":null,"storage_bytes":557296407087,"files_count":42,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["LlamaForCausalLM"],"model_type":"llama","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"<s>","lstrip":false,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false},"eos_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"</s>","lstrip":false,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false},"pad_token":null,"unk_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"<unk>","lstrip":false,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false}}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2307.09288","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2306.02707","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707"}]', NULL, NULL, 'pending', 54.5, 'ada08a7355fcd76dfbae444b4a2b8f8a', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2:\n\n- Significantly **more knowledge** and has greatly improved capabilities in **coding** and **mathematics**, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains.\n- Significant improvements in **instruction following**, **generating long texts** (over 8K tokens), **understanding structured data** (e.g, tables), and **generating structured outputs** especially JSON. **More resilient to the diversity of system prompts**, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.\n- **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.\n- **Multilingual support** for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. \n\n**This repo contains the instruction-tuned 72B Qwen2.5 model**, which has the following features:\n- Type: Causal Language Models\n- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\n- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias\n- Number of Parameters: 72.7B\n- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 70.0B\n- Number of Layers: 80\n- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 64 for Q and 8 for KV\n- Context Length: Full 131,072 tokens and generation 8192 tokens\n  - Please refer to [this section](#processing-long-texts) for detailed instructions on how to deploy Qwen2.5 for handling long texts.\n\nFor more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen2''\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\nHere provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct"\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nprompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant."},\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=512\n)\ngenerated_ids = [\n    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n]\n\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n```\n\n### Processing Long Texts\n\nThe current `config.json` is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.\nTo handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.\n\nFor supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:\n```json\n{\n  ...,\n  "rope_scaling": {\n    "factor": 4.0,\n    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768,\n    "type": "yarn"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor deployment, we recommend using vLLM. \nPlease refer to our [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html) for usage if you are not familar with vLLM.\nPresently, vLLM only supports static YARN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts**. \nWe advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required.\n\n## Evaluation & Performance\n\nDetailed evaluation results are reported in this [📑 blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/).\n\nFor requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen2.5,\n    title = {Qwen2.5: A Party of Foundation Models},\n    url = {https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/},\n    author = {Qwen Team},\n    month = {September},\n    year = {2024}\n}\n\n@article{qwen2,\n      title={Qwen2 Technical Report}, \n      author={An Yang and Baosong Yang and Binyuan Hui and Bo Zheng and Bowen Yu and Chang Zhou and Chengpeng Li and Chengyuan Li and Dayiheng Liu and Fei Huang and Guanting Dong and Haoran Wei and Huan Lin and Jialong Tang and Jialin Wang and Jian Yang and Jianhong Tu and Jianwei Zhang and Jianxin Ma and Jin Xu and Jingren Zhou and Jinze Bai and Jinzheng He and Junyang Lin and Kai Dang and Keming Lu and Keqin Chen and Kexin Yang and Mei Li and Mingfeng Xue and Na Ni and Pei Zhang and Peng Wang and Ru Peng and Rui Men and Ruize Gao and Runji Lin and Shijie Wang and Shuai Bai and Sinan Tan and Tianhang Zhu and Tianhao Li and Tianyu Liu and Wenbin Ge and Xiaodong Deng and Xiaohuan Zhou and Xingzhang Ren and Xinyu Zhang and Xipin Wei and Xuancheng Ren and Yang Fan and Yang Yao and Yichang Zhang and Yu Wan and Yunfei Chu and Yuqiong Liu and Zeyu Cui and Zhenru Zhang and Zhihao Fan},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.10671},\n      year={2024}\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":72706203648,"storage_bytes":145412519312,"files_count":47,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Qwen2ForCausalLM"],"model_type":"qwen2","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":null,"chat_template":"{%- if tools %}\n    {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' }}\n    {%- if messages[0][''role''] == ''system'' %}\n        {{- messages[0][''content''] }}\n    {%- else %}\n        {{- ''You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

It did however reduce BigBench benchmark score, but the net gain overall is significant.\n\nThe code it trained on also improved it''s humaneval score (benchmarking done by Glaive team) from **43% @ Pass 1** with Open Herms 2 to **50.7% @ Pass 1** with Open Hermes 2.5.\n\nOpenHermes was trained on 1,000,000 entries of primarily GPT-4 generated data, as well as other high quality data from open datasets across the AI landscape. [More details soon]\n\nFiltering was extensive of these public datasets, as well as conversion of all formats to ShareGPT, which was then further transformed by axolotl to use ChatML.\n\nHuge thank you to [GlaiveAI](https://twitter.com/glaiveai) and [a16z](https://twitter.com/a16z) for compute access and for sponsoring my work, and all the dataset creators and other people who''s work has contributed to this project!\n\nFollow all my updates in ML and AI on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Teknium1\n\nSupport me on Github Sponsors: https://github.com/sponsors/teknium1\n\n**NEW**: Chat with Hermes on LMSys'' Chat Website! https://chat.lmsys.org/?single&model=openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b\n\n# Table of Contents\n1.

hermes-2 coder, but found that it can have generalist improvements to the model, so I settled for slightly less code capabilities, for maximum generalist ones. That said, code capabilities had a decent jump alongside the overall capabilities of the model:\nGlaive performed HumanEval testing on Hermes-2.5 and found a score of:\n\n**50.7% @ Pass1**\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6317aade83d8d2fd903192d9/IeeZnGmEyK73ejq0fKEms.png)\n\n# Prompt Format\n\nOpenHermes 2.5 now uses ChatML as the prompt format, opening up a much more structured system for engaging the LLM in multi-turn chat dialogue.\n\nSystem prompts are now a thing that matters! Hermes 2.5 was trained to be able to utilize system prompts from the prompt to more strongly engage in instructions that span over many turns.\n\nThis is a more complex format than alpaca or sharegpt, where special tokens were added to denote the beginning and end of any turn, along with roles for the turns.\n\nThis format enables OpenAI endpoint compatability, and people familiar with ChatGPT API will be familiar with the format, as it is the same used by OpenAI.\n\nPrompt with system instruction (Use whatever system prompt you like, this is just an example!):\n```\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are "Hermes 2", a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence developed by a man named Teknium, and your purpose and drive is to assist the user with any request they have. You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nHello, who are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHi there! My name is Hermes 2, a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence. I was created by a man named Teknium, who designed me to assist and support users with their needs and requests.<|im_end|>\n```\n\nThis prompt is available as a [chat template](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating), which means you can format messages using the\n`tokenizer.apply_chat_template()` method:\n\n```python\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Hermes 2."},\n    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}\n]\ngen_input = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(message, return_tensors="pt")\nmodel.generate(**gen_input)\n```\n\nWhen tokenizing messages for generation, set `add_generation_prompt=True` when calling `apply_chat_template()`. This will append `<|im_start|>assistant\n` to your prompt, to ensure\nthat the model continues with an assistant response.\n\nTo utilize the prompt format without a system prompt, simply leave the line out.\n\nCurrently, I recommend using LM Studio for chatting with Hermes 2. It is a GUI application that utilizes GGUF models with a llama.cpp backend and provides a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with the model, and supports ChatML right out of the box.\nIn LM-Studio, simply select the ChatML Prefix on the settings side pane:\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6317aade83d8d2fd903192d9/ls6WqV-GSxMw2RA3GuQiN.png)\n\n# Quantized Models:\n\nGGUF: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF\nGPTQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GPTQ\nAWQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-AWQ\nEXL2: https://huggingface.co/bartowski/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-exl2\n\n[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/main/image/axolotl-badge-web.png" alt="Built with Axolotl" width="200" height="32"/>](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl)\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":7241748480,"storage_bytes":28967621684,"files_count":15,"spaces_count":90,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["MistralForCausalLM"],"model_type":"mistral","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"<s>","eos_token":"<|im_end|>","chat_template":"{% for message in messages %}{{''<|im_start|>'' + message[''role''] + ''\n'' + message[''content''] + ''<|im_end|>'' + ''\n''}}{% endfor %}{% if add_generation_prompt %}{{ ''<|im_start|>assistant\n'' }}{% endif %}","pad_token":null,"unk_token":"<unk>","use_default_system_prompt":true}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:sponsors:teknium1","source_url":"https://github.com/sponsors/teknium1"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:OpenAccess-AI-Collective:axolotl","source_url":"https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 79.4, 'fb21922bb9da897e27941bee34f1ef84', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

As of August 21st 2023, [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) no longer supports GGML models. Third party clients and libraries are expected to still support it for a time, but many may also drop support.\n\nPlease use the GGUF models instead.\n### About GGML\n\nGGML files are for CPU + GPU inference using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and libraries and UIs which support this format, such as:\n* [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), the most popular web UI. Supports NVidia CUDA GPU acceleration.\n* [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), a powerful GGML web UI with GPU acceleration on all platforms (CUDA and OpenCL). Especially good for story telling.\n* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), a fully featured local GUI with GPU acceleration on both Windows (NVidia and AMD), and macOS.\n* [LoLLMS Web UI](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui), a great web UI with CUDA GPU acceleration via the c_transformers backend.\n* [ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers), a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible AI server.\n* [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible API server.\n\n## Repositories available\n\n* [GPTQ models for GPU inference, with multiple quantisation parameter options.](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ)\n* [2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8-bit GGUF models for CPU+GPU inference](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF)\n* [2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8-bit GGML models for CPU+GPU inference (deprecated)](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGML)\n* [Meta Llama 2''s original unquantised fp16 model in pytorch format, for GPU inference and for further conversions](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)\n\n## Prompt template: Llama-2-Chat\n\n```\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

This may change in the future.\n\n## Explanation of the new k-quant methods\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to see details</summary>\n\nThe new methods available are:\n* GGML_TYPE_Q2_K - "type-1" 2-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weight. Block scales and mins are quantized with 4 bits. This ends up effectively using 2.5625 bits per weight (bpw)\n* GGML_TYPE_Q3_K - "type-0" 3-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 6 bits. This end up using 3.4375 bpw.\n* GGML_TYPE_Q4_K - "type-1" 4-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 8 blocks, each block having 32 weights. Scales and mins are quantized with 6 bits. This ends up using 4.5 bpw.\n* GGML_TYPE_Q5_K - "type-1" 5-bit quantization. Same super-block structure as GGML_TYPE_Q4_K resulting in 5.5 bpw\n* GGML_TYPE_Q6_K - "type-0" 6-bit quantization. Super-blocks with 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 8 bits. This ends up using 6.5625 bpw\n* GGML_TYPE_Q8_K - "type-0" 8-bit quantization. Only used for quantizing intermediate results. The difference to the existing Q8_0 is that the block size is 256. All 2-6 bit dot products are implemented for this quantization type.\n\nRefer to the Provided Files table below to see what files use which methods, and how.\n</details>\n<!-- compatibility_ggml end -->\n\n## Provided files\n\n| Name | Quant method | Bits | Size | Max RAM required | Use case |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- |\n| llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin | q2_K | 2 | 2.87 GB| 5.37 GB | New k-quant method.

In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the [website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and accept our License before requesting access here.*\n\nMeta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\n\n**Model Developers** Meta\n\n**Variations** Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\n\n**Input** Models input text only.\n\n**Output** Models generate text only.\n\n**Model Architecture** Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\n\n\n||Training Data|Params|Content Length|GQA|Tokens|LR|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|7B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|\n|Llama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|13B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|\n|Llama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|70B|4k|&#10004;|2.0T|1.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|\n\n*Llama 2 family of models.* Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models -  70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\n\n**Model Dates** Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\n\n**Status** This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\n\n**License** A custom commercial license is available at: [https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)\n\n**Research Paper** ["Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models"](arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)\n\n## Intended Use\n**Intended Use Cases** Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\n\nTo get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the `INST` and `<<SYS>>` tags, `BOS` and `EOS` tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling `strip()` on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: [`chat_completion`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/generation.py#L212).\n\n**Out-of-scope Uses** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.\n\n## Hardware and Software\n**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries, Meta''s Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\n\n**Carbon Footprint** Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\n\n||Time (GPU hours)|Power Consumption (W)|Carbon Emitted(tCO<sub>2</sub>eq)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 2 7B|184320|400|31.22|\n|Llama 2 13B|368640|400|62.44|\n|Llama 2 70B|1720320|400|291.42|\n|Total|3311616||539.00|\n\n**CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during pretraining.** Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta''s sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\n\n## Training Data\n**Overview** Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\n\n**Data Freshness** The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\n\n## Evaluation Results\n\nIn this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.\n\n|Model|Size|Code|Commonsense Reasoning|World Knowledge|Reading Comprehension|Math|MMLU|BBH|AGI Eval|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 1|7B|14.1|60.8|46.2|58.5|6.95|35.1|30.3|23.9|\n|Llama 1|13B|18.9|66.1|52.6|62.3|10.9|46.9|37.0|33.9|\n|Llama 1|33B|26.0|70.0|58.4|67.6|21.4|57.8|39.8|41.7|\n|Llama 1|65B|30.7|70.7|60.5|68.6|30.8|63.4|43.5|47.6|\n|Llama 2|7B|16.8|63.9|48.9|61.3|14.6|45.3|32.6|29.3|\n|Llama 2|13B|24.5|66.9|55.4|65.8|28.7|54.8|39.4|39.1|\n|Llama 2|70B|**37.5**|**71.9**|**63.6**|**69.4**|**35.2**|**68.9**|**51.2**|**54.2**|\n\n**Overall performance on grouped academic benchmarks.** *Code:* We report the average pass@1 scores of our models on HumanEval and MBPP. *Commonsense Reasoning:* We report the average of PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC easy and challenge, OpenBookQA, and CommonsenseQA.

Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\n\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at [https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/](https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide)\n\n## Reporting Issues\nPlease report any software “bug,” or other problems with the models through one of the following means:\n- Reporting issues with the model: [github.com/facebookresearch/llama](http://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)\n- Reporting problematic content generated by the model: [developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback](http://developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback)\n- Reporting bugs and security concerns: [facebook.com/whitehat/info](http://facebook.com/whitehat/info)\n\n## Llama Model Index\n|Model|Llama2|Llama2-hf|Llama2-chat|Llama2-chat-hf|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|7B| [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-7b) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-7b-hf) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-7b-chat) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)|\n|13B| [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-13b) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-13b-hf) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-13b-chat) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-13b-hf)|\n|70B| [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-70b) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-70b-hf) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-70b-chat) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/llamaste/Llama-2-70b-hf)|\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":null,"storage_bytes":60421177985,"files_count":20,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"model_type":"llama"}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggerganov:llama.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggerganov:llama.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:oobabooga:text-generation-webui","source_url":"https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LostRuins:koboldcpp","source_url":"https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ParisNeo:lollms-webui","source_url":"https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:marella:ctransformers","source_url":"https://github.com/marella/ctransformers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:abetlen:llama-cpp-python","source_url":"https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggerganov:llama.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggerganov:llama.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggerganov:llama.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:oobabooga:text-generation-webui","source_url":"https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:facebookresearch:llama","source_url":"https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:facebookresearch:llama","source_url":"http://github.com/facebookresearch/llama"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2307.09288","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288"}]', NULL, 'Other', 'approved', 79.4, '97b28da2847e75ffa2c05558287b49bd', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

With **Wan2.2**, we have focused on incorporating the following innovations:\n\n- 👍 **Effective MoE Architecture**: Wan2.2 introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into video diffusion models. By separating the denoising process cross timesteps with specialized powerful expert models, this enlarges the overall model capacity while maintaining the same computational cost.\n\n- 👍 **Cinematic-level Aesthetics**: Wan2.2 incorporates meticulously curated aesthetic data, complete with detailed labels for lighting, composition, contrast, color tone, and more. This allows for more precise and controllable cinematic style generation, facilitating the creation of videos with customizable aesthetic preferences.\n\n- 👍 **Complex Motion Generation**: Compared to Wan2.1, Wan2.2 is trained on a significantly larger data, with +65.6% more images and +83.2% more videos. This expansion notably enhances the model''s generalization across multiple dimensions such as motions,  semantics, and aesthetics, achieving TOP performance among all open-sourced and closed-sourced models. \n\n- 👍 **Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V**:  Wan2.2 open-sources a 5B model built with our advanced Wan2.2-VAE that achieves a compression ratio of **16×16×4**. This model supports both text-to-video and image-to-video generation at 720P resolution with 24fps and can also run on consumer-grade graphics cards like 4090. It is one of the fastest **720P@24fps** models currently available, capable of serving both the industrial and academic sectors simultaneously.\n\n\n## Video Demos\n\n<div align="center">\n    <video width="80%" controls>\n        <source src="https://cloud.video.taobao.com/vod/4szTT1B0LqXvJzmuEURfGRA-nllnqN_G2AT0ZWkQXoQ.mp4" type="video/mp4">\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n</div>\n\n## 🔥 Latest News!!\n\n* Sep 19, 2025: 💃 We introduct **[Wan2.2-Animate-14B](https://humanaigc.github.io/wan-animate)**, an unified model for character animation and replacement with holistic movement and expression replication.

This upgrade is driven by a series of key technical innovations, mainly including the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, upgraded training data, and high-compression video generation.\n\n##### (1) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture\n\nWan2.2 introduces Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into the video generation diffusion model. MoE has been widely validated in large language models as an efficient approach to increase total model parameters while keeping inference cost nearly unchanged. In Wan2.2, the A14B model series adopts a two-expert design tailored to the denoising process of diffusion models: a high-noise expert for the early stages, focusing on overall layout; and a low-noise expert for the later stages, refining video details. Each expert model has about 14B parameters, resulting in a total of 27B parameters but only 14B active parameters per step, keeping inference computation and GPU memory nearly unchanged.\n\n<div align="center">\n    <img src="assets/moe_arch.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;" />\n</div>\n\nThe transition point between the two experts is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a metric that decreases monotonically as the denoising step $t$ increases. At the beginning of the denoising process, $t$ is large and the noise level is high, so the SNR is at its minimum, denoted as ${SNR}_{min}$. In this stage, the high-noise expert is activated. We define a threshold step ${t}_{moe}$ corresponding to half of the ${SNR}_{min}$, and switch to the low-noise expert when $t<{t}_{moe}$.\n\n<div align="center">\n    <img src="assets/moe_2.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;" />\n</div>\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of the MoE architecture, four settings are compared based on their validation loss curves. The baseline **Wan2.1** model does not employ the MoE architecture. Among the MoE-based variants, the **Wan2.1 & High-Noise Expert** reuses the Wan2.1 model as the low-noise expert while uses the  Wan2.2''s high-noise expert, while the **Wan2.1 & Low-Noise Expert** uses Wan2.1 as the high-noise expert and employ the Wan2.2''s low-noise expert. The **Wan2.2 (MoE)** (our final version) achieves the lowest validation loss, indicating that its generated video distribution is closest to ground-truth and exhibits superior convergence.\n\n\n##### (2) Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V\nTo enable more efficient deployment, Wan2.2 also explores a high-compression design. In addition to the 27B MoE models, a 5B dense model, i.e., TI2V-5B, is released. It is supported by a high-compression Wan2.2-VAE, which achieves a $T\times H\times W$ compression ratio of $4\times16\times16$, increasing the overall compression rate to 64 while maintaining high-quality video reconstruction. With an additional patchification layer, the total compression ratio of TI2V-5B reaches $4\times32\times32$. Without specific optimization, TI2V-5B can generate a 5-second 720P video in under 9 minutes on a single consumer-grade GPU, ranking among the fastest 720P@24fps video generation models. This model also natively supports both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks within a single unified framework, covering both academic research and practical applications.\n\n\n<div align="center">\n    <img src="assets/vae.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;" />\n</div>\n\n\n\n##### Comparisons to SOTAs\nWe compared Wan2.2 with leading closed-source commercial models on our new Wan-Bench 2.0, evaluating performance across multiple crucial dimensions. The results demonstrate that Wan2.2 achieves superior performance compared to these leading models.\n\n\n<div align="center">\n    <img src="assets/performance.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;" />\n</div>\n\n## Citation\nIf you find our work helpful, please cite us.\n\n```\n@article{wan2025,\n      title={Wan: Open and Advanced Large-Scale Video Generative Models}, \n      author={Team Wan and Ang Wang and Baole Ai and Bin Wen and Chaojie Mao and Chen-Wei Xie and Di Chen and Feiwu Yu and Haiming Zhao and Jianxiao Yang and Jianyuan Zeng and Jiayu Wang and Jingfeng Zhang and Jingren Zhou and Jinkai Wang and Jixuan Chen and Kai Zhu and Kang Zhao and Keyu Yan and Lianghua Huang and Mengyang Feng and Ningyi Zhang and Pandeng Li and Pingyu Wu and Ruihang Chu and Ruili Feng and Shiwei Zhang and Siyang Sun and Tao Fang and Tianxing Wang and Tianyi Gui and Tingyu Weng and Tong Shen and Wei Lin and Wei Wang and Wei Wang and Wenmeng Zhou and Wente Wang and Wenting Shen and Wenyuan Yu and Xianzhong Shi and Xiaoming Huang and Xin Xu and Yan Kou and Yangyu Lv and Yifei Li and Yijing Liu and Yiming Wang and Yingya Zhang and Yitong Huang and Yong Li and You Wu and Yu Liu and Yulin Pan and Yun Zheng and Yuntao Hong and Yupeng Shi and Yutong Feng and Zeyinzi Jiang and Zhen Han and Zhi-Fan Wu and Ziyu Liu},\n      journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.20314},\n      year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n## License Agreement\nThe models in this repository are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

[Model Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/distilbert#transformers.DistilBertForSequenceClassification)\n    - [DistilBERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)\n\n## How to Get Started With the Model\n\nExample of single-label classification:\n​​\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, DistilBertForSequenceClassification\n\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")\nmodel = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")\n\ninputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    logits = model(**inputs).logits\n\npredicted_class_id = logits.argmax().item()\nmodel.config.id2label[predicted_class_id]\n\n```\n\n## Uses\n\n#### Direct Use\n\nThis model can be used for  topic classification. You can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it''s mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. In addition, the model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\nBased on a few experimentations, we observed that this model could produce biased predictions that target underrepresented populations.\n\nFor instance, for sentences like `This film was filmed in COUNTRY`, this binary classification model will give radically different probabilities for the positive label depending on the country (0.89 if the country is France, but 0.08 if the country is Afghanistan) when nothing in the input indicates such a strong semantic shift. In this [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ageron/fb2f64fb145b4bc7c49efc97e5f114d3/biasmap.ipynb), [Aurélien Géron](https://twitter.com/aureliengeron) made an interesting map plotting these probabilities for each country.\n\n<img src="https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english/resolve/main/map.jpeg" alt="Map of positive probabilities per country." width="500"/>\n\nWe strongly advise users to thoroughly probe these aspects on their use-cases in order to evaluate the risks of this model. We recommend looking at the following bias evaluation datasets as a place to start: [WinoBias](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wino_bias), [WinoGender](https://huggingface.co/datasets/super_glue), [Stereoset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stereoset).\n\n\n\n# Training\n\n\n#### Training Data\n\n\nThe authors use the following Stanford Sentiment Treebank([sst2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sst2)) corpora for the model.\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\n###### Fine-tuning hyper-parameters\n\n\n- learning_rate = 1e-5\n- batch_size = 32\n- warmup = 600\n- max_seq_length = 128\n- num_train_epochs = 3.0\n\n\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-classification","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":66955010,"storage_bytes":2208990137,"files_count":17,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["DistilBertForSequenceClassification"],"model_type":"distilbert","tokenizer_config":{}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:1910.01108","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 79.3, '83221cd17c2b62b0f476931c3b2516f1', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Devstral excels at using tools to explore codebases, editing multiple files and power software engineering agents. The model achieves remarkable performance on SWE-bench which positionates it as the #1 open source model on this [benchmark](#benchmark-results). \n\nIt is finetuned from [Mistral-Small-3.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Base-2503), therefore it has a long context window of up to 128k tokens. As a coding agent, Devstral is text-only and before fine-tuning from `Mistral-Small-3.1` the vision encoder was removed.\n\nFor enterprises requiring specialized capabilities (increased context, domain-specific knowledge, etc.), we will release commercial models beyond what Mistral AI contributes to the community.\n\nLearn more about Devstral in our [blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/devstral).\n\n\n## Key Features:\n- **Agentic coding**: Devstral is designed to excel at agentic coding tasks, making it a great choice for software engineering agents.\n- **lightweight**: with its compact size of just 24 billion parameters, Devstral is light enough to run on a single RTX 4090 or a Mac with 32GB RAM, making it an appropriate model for local deployment and on-device use.\n- **Apache 2.0 License**: Open license allowing usage and modification for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.\n- **Context Window**: A 128k context window.\n- **Tokenizer**: Utilizes a Tekken tokenizer with a 131k vocabulary size.\n\n\n\n## Benchmark Results\n\n### SWE-Bench\n\nDevstral achieves a score of 46.8% on SWE-Bench Verified, outperforming prior open-source SoTA by 6%.\n\n| Model            | Scaffold           | SWE-Bench Verified (%) |\n|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Devstral         | OpenHands Scaffold | **46.8**               |\n| GPT-4.1-mini     | OpenAI Scaffold    | 23.6                   |\n| Claude 3.5 Haiku | Anthropic Scaffold | 40.6                   |\n| SWE-smith-LM 32B | SWE-agent Scaffold | 40.2                   |\n\n\n When evaluated under the same test scaffold (OpenHands, provided by All Hands AI 🙌), Devstral exceeds far larger models such as Deepseek-V3-0324 and Qwen3 232B-A22B.\n\n![SWE Benchmark](assets/swe_bench.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nWe recommend to use Devstral with the [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main) scaffold.\nYou can use it either through our API or by running locally. \n\n### API \nFollow these [instructions](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/quickstart/#account-setup) to create a Mistral account and get an API key.\n\nThen run these commands to start the OpenHands docker container.\n```bash\nexport MISTRAL_API_KEY=<MY_KEY>\n\ndocker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.39-nikolaik\n\nmkdir -p ~/.openhands-state && echo ''{"language":"en","agent":"CodeActAgent","max_iterations":null,"security_analyzer":null,"confirmation_mode":false,"llm_model":"mistral/devstral-small-2505","llm_api_key":"''$MISTRAL_API_KEY''","remote_runtime_resource_factor":null,"github_token":null,"enable_default_condenser":true}'' > ~/.openhands-state/settings.json\n\ndocker run -it --rm --pull=always \\n    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.39-nikolaik \\n    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \\n    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\n    -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \\n    -p 3000:3000 \\n    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\n    --name openhands-app \\n    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.39\n```\n\n### Local inference \n\nThe model can also be deployed with the following libraries:\n- [`vllm (recommended)`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm): See [here](#vllm-recommended)\n- [`mistral-inference`](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference): See [here](#mistral-inference)\n- [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers): See [here](#transformers)\n- [`LMStudio`](https://lmstudio.ai/): See [here](#lmstudio)\n- [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp): See [here](#llama.cpp)\n- [`ollama`](https://github.com/ollama/ollama): See [here](#ollama)\n\n\n### OpenHands (recommended)\n\n#### Launch a server to deploy Devstral Small 1.0\n\nMake sure you launched an OpenAI-compatible server such as vLLM or Ollama as described above. Then, you can use OpenHands to interact with `Devstral Small 1.0`.\n\nIn the case of the tutorial we spineed up a vLLM server running the command:\n```bash\nvllm serve mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505 --tokenizer_mode mistral --config_format mistral --load_format mistral --tool-call-parser mistral --enable-auto-tool-choice --tensor-parallel-size 2\n```\n\nThe server address should be in the following format: `http://<your-server-url>:8000/v1`\n\n#### Launch OpenHands\n\nYou can follow installation of OpenHands [here](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/installation).\n\nThe easiest way to launch OpenHands is to use the Docker image:\n```bash\ndocker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.38-nikolaik\n\ndocker run -it --rm --pull=always \\n    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.38-nikolaik \\n    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \\n    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\n    -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \\n    -p 3000:3000 \\n    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\n    --name openhands-app \\n    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.38\n```\n\n\nThen, you can access the OpenHands UI at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n#### Connect to the server\n\nWhen accessing the OpenHands UI, you will be prompted to connect to a server. You can use the advanced mode to connect to the server you launched earlier.\n\nFill the following fields:\n- **Custom Model**: `openai/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505`\n- **Base URL**: `http://<your-server-url>:8000/v1`\n- **API Key**: `token` (or any other token you used to launch the server if any)\n\n#### Use OpenHands powered by Devstral\n\nNow you''re good to use Devstral Small inside OpenHands by **starting a new conversation**. Let''s build a To-Do list app.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>To-Do list app</summary\n\n1. Let''s ask Devstral to generate the app with the following prompt:\n\n```txt\nBuild a To-Do list app with the following requirements:\n- Built using FastAPI and React.\n- Make it a one page app that:\n   - Allows to add a task.\n   - Allows to delete a task.\n   - Allows to mark a task as done.\n   - Displays the list of tasks.\n- Store the tasks in a SQLite database.\n```\n\n![Agent prompting](assets/tuto_open_hands/agent_prompting.png)\n\n\n2. Let''s see the result\n\nYou should see the agent construct the app and be able to explore the code it generated.\n\nIf it doesn''t do it automatically, ask Devstral to deploy the app or do it manually, and then go the front URL deployment to see the app.\n\n![Agent working](assets/tuto_open_hands/agent_working.png)\n![App UI](assets/tuto_open_hands/app_ui.png)\n\n\n3. Iterate\n\nNow that you have a first result you can iterate on it by asking your agent to improve it. For example, in the app generated we could click on a task to mark it checked but having a checkbox would improve UX. You could also ask it to add a feature to edit a task, or to add a feature to filter the tasks by status.\n\nEnjoy building with Devstral Small and OpenHands!\n\n</details>\n\n\n### vLLM (recommended)\n\nWe recommend using this model with the [vLLM library](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)\nto implement production-ready inference pipelines.\n\n**_Installation_**\n\nMake sure you install [`vLLM >= 0.8.5`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.8.5):\n\n```\npip install vllm --upgrade\n```\n\nDoing so should automatically install [`mistral_common >= 1.5.5`](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-common/releases/tag/v1.5.5).\n\nTo check:\n```\npython -c "import mistral_common; print(mistral_common.__version__)"\n```\n\nYou can also make use of a ready-to-go [docker image](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/Dockerfile) or on the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/layers/vllm/vllm-openai/latest/images/sha256-de9032a92ffea7b5c007dad80b38fd44aac11eddc31c435f8e52f3b7404bbf39).\n\n#### Server\n\nWe recommand that you use Devstral in a server/client setting. \n\n1. Spin up a server:\n\n```\nvllm serve mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505 --tokenizer_mode mistral --config_format mistral --load_format mistral --tool-call-parser mistral --enable-auto-tool-choice --tensor-parallel-size 2\n```\n\n\n2. To ping the client you can use a simple Python snippet.\n\n```py\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\n\n\nurl = "http://<your-server-url>:8000/v1/chat/completions"\nheaders = {"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer token"}\n\nmodel = "mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505"\n\ndef load_system_prompt(repo_id: str, filename: str) -> str:\n    file_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id=repo_id, filename=filename)\n    with open(file_path, "r") as file:\n        system_prompt = file.read()\n    return system_prompt\n\nSYSTEM_PROMPT = load_system_prompt(model, "SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt")\n\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {\n                "type": "text",\n                "text": "<your-command>",\n            },\n        ],\n    },\n]\n\ndata = {"model": model, "messages": messages, "temperature": 0.15}\n\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))\nprint(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])\n```\n\n### Mistral-inference\n\nWe recommend using mistral-inference to quickly try out / "vibe-check" Devstral.\n\n#### Install\n\nMake sure to have mistral_inference >= 1.6.0 installed.\n\n```bash\npip install mistral_inference --upgrade\n```\n\n#### Download\n\n```python\nfrom huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nmistral_models_path = Path.home().joinpath(''mistral_models'', ''Devstral'')\nmistral_models_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n\nsnapshot_download(repo_id="mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505", allow_patterns=["params.json", "consolidated.safetensors", "tekken.json"], local_dir=mistral_models_path)\n```\n\n#### Python\n\nYou can run the model using the following command:\n\n```bash\nmistral-chat $HOME/mistral_models/Devstral --instruct --max_tokens 300\n```\n\nYou can then prompt it with anything you''d like.\n\n### Transformers\n\nTo make the best use of our model with transformers make sure to have [installed](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-common) `    mistral-common >= 1.5.5` to use our tokenizer.\n\n```bash\npip install mistral-common --upgrade\n```\n\nThen load our tokenizer along with the model and generate:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.messages import (\n    SystemMessage, UserMessage\n)\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.request import ChatCompletionRequest\nfrom mistral_common.tokens.tokenizers.mistral import MistralTokenizer\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ndef load_system_prompt(repo_id: str, filename: str) -> str:\n    file_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id=repo_id, filename=filename)\n    with open(file_path, "r") as file:\n        system_prompt = file.read()\n    return system_prompt\n\nmodel_id = "mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505"\ntekken_file = hf_hub_download(repo_id=model_id, filename="tekken.json")\nSYSTEM_PROMPT = load_system_prompt(model_id, "SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt")\n\ntokenizer = MistralTokenizer.from_file(tekken_file)\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\ntokenized = tokenizer.encode_chat_completion(\n    ChatCompletionRequest(\n        messages=[\n            SystemMessage(content=SYSTEM_PROMPT),\n            UserMessage(content="<your-command>"),\n        ],\n    )\n)\n\noutput = model.generate(\n    input_ids=torch.tensor([tokenized.tokens]),\n    max_new_tokens=1000,\n)[0]\n\ndecoded_output = tokenizer.decode(output[len(tokenized.tokens):])\nprint(decoded_output)\n```\n\n### LMStudio\nDownload the weights from huggingface:\n\n```\npip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"\nhuggingface-cli download \\n"mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505_gguf" \\n--include "devstralQ4_K_M.gguf" \\n--local-dir "mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505_gguf/"\n```\n\nYou can serve the model locally with [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/).\n* Download [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) and install it\n* Install `lms cli ~/.lmstudio/bin/lms bootstrap`\n* In a bash terminal, run `lms import devstralQ4_K_M.gguf` in the directory where you''ve downloaded the model checkpoint (e.g. `mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505_gguf`)\n* Open the LMStudio application, click the terminal icon to get into the developer tab. Click select a model to load and select Devstral Q4 K M. Toggle the status button to start the model, in setting toggle Serve on Local Network to be on.\n* On the right tab, you will see an API identifier which should be devstralq4_k_m and an api address under API Usage. Keep note of this address, we will use it in the next step.\n\nLaunch Openhands\nYou can now interact with the model served from LM Studio with openhands. Start the openhands server with the docker\n\n```bash\ndocker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.38-nikolaik\ndocker run -it --rm --pull=always \\n	-e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.38-nikolaik \\n	-e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \\n	-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\n	-v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \\n	-p 3000:3000 \\n	--add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\n	--name openhands-app \\n	docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.38\n```\n\nClick “see advanced setting” on the second line. \nIn the new tab, toggle advanced to on. Set the custom model to be mistral/devstralq4_k_m and Base URL the api address we get from the last step in LM Studio. Set API Key to dummy. Click save changes.\n\n### llama.cpp\n\nDownload the weights from huggingface:\n\n```\npip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"\nhuggingface-cli download \\n"mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505_gguf" \\n--include "devstralQ4_K_M.gguf" \\n--local-dir "mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505_gguf/"\n```\n\nThen run Devstral using the llama.cpp CLI.\n\n```bash\n./llama-cli -m Devstral-Small-2505_gguf/devstralQ4_K_M.gguf -cnv\n```\n\n### Ollama\n\nYou can run Devstral using the [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) CLI.\n\n```bash\nollama run devstral\n```\n\n### Example: Understanding Test Coverage of Mistral Common\n\nWe can start the OpenHands scaffold and link it to a repo to analyze test coverage and identify badly covered files.\nHere we start with our public `mistral-common` repo.\n\n\nAfter the repo is mounted in the workspace, we give the following instruction\n```\nCheck the test coverage of the repo and then create a visualization of test coverage. Try plotting a few different types of graphs and save them to a png.\n```\nThe agent will first browse the code base to check test configuration and structure.\n\n![Repo Exploration](assets/images_example/example_mistral_common_1.png)\n\nThen it sets up the testing dependencies and launches the coverage test:\n\n![Repo Exploration](assets/images_example/example_mistral_common_2.png)\n\nFinally, the agent writes necessary code to visualize the coverage.\n![Repo Exploration](assets/images_example/example_mistral_common_3.png)\n\nAt the end of the run, the following plots are produced:\n![Repo Exploration](assets/images_example/example_mistral_common_res_1.png)\n![Repo Exploration](assets/images_example/example_mistral_common_res_2.png)\n![Repo Exploration](assets/images_example/example_mistral_common_res_3.png)', '{"pipeline_tag":null,"library_name":"vllm","framework":"vllm","params":23572403200,"storage_bytes":94324335088,"files_count":29,"spaces_count":26,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["MistralForCausalLM"],"model_type":"mistral"}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:All-Hands-AI:OpenHands","source_url":"https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:vllm-project:vllm","source_url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:mistralai:mistral-inference","source_url":"https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggml-org:llama.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ollama:ollama","source_url":"https://github.com/ollama/ollama"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:vllm-project:vllm","source_url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:vllm-project:vllm","source_url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:mistralai:mistral-common","source_url":"https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-common"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:vllm-project:vllm","source_url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:mistralai:mistral-common","source_url":"https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-common"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 99.3, 'b91ba747cfdd9d384ac5a16e31b3ea14', NULL, 'https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505/resolve/main/assets/images_example/example_mistral_common_1.png', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

[Model Card Authors](#model-card-authors)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nIf you already know T5, FLAN-T5 is just better at everything. For the same number of parameters, these models have been fine-tuned on more than 1000 additional tasks covering also more languages. \nAs mentioned in the first few lines of the abstract : \n>  Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints,1 which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Content from **this** model card has been written by the Hugging Face team, and parts of it were copy pasted from the [T5 model card](https://huggingface.co/t5-large).\n\n# Model Details\n\n## Model Description\n\n\n- **Model type:** Language model\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** English, Spanish, Japanese, Persian, Hindi, French, Chinese, Bengali, Gujarati, German, Telugu, Italian, Arabic, Polish, Tamil, Marathi, Malayalam, Oriya, Panjabi, Portuguese, Urdu, Galician, Hebrew, Korean, Catalan, Thai, Dutch, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Bulgarian, Filipino, Central Khmer, Lao, Turkish, Russian, Croatian, Swedish, Yoruba, Kurdish, Burmese, Malay, Czech, Finnish, Somali, Tagalog, Swahili, Sinhala, Kannada, Zhuang, Igbo, Xhosa, Romanian, Haitian, Estonian, Slovak, Lithuanian, Greek, Nepali, Assamese, Norwegian\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Related Models:** [All FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?search=flan-t5)\n- **Original Checkpoints:** [All Original FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/docs/models.md#flan-t5-checkpoints)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf)\n  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/google-research/t5x)\n  - [Hugging Face FLAN-T5 Docs (Similar to T5) ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5)\n\n# Usage\n\nFind below some example scripts on how to use the model in `transformers`:\n\n## Using the Pytorch model\n\n### Running the model on a CPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large")\n\ninput_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large", device_map="auto")\n\ninput_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU using different precisions\n\n#### FP16\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large", device_map="auto", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\n\ninput_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### INT8\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install bitsandbytes accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-large", device_map="auto", load_in_8bit=True)\n\ninput_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n# Uses\n\n## Direct Use and Downstream Use\n\nThe authors write in [the original paper''s model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) that: \n\n> The primary use is research on language models, including: research on zero-shot NLP tasks and in-context few-shot learning NLP tasks, such as reasoning, and question answering; advancing fairness and safety research, and understanding limitations of current large language models\n\nSee the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) for further details.\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\nMore information needed.\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nThe information below in this section are copied from the model''s [official model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> Language models, including Flan-T5, can potentially be used for language generation in a harmful way, according to Rae et al. (2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.\n\n## Ethical considerations and risks\n\n> Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n> Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.\n\n## Sensitive Use:\n\n> Flan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe model was trained on a mixture of tasks, that includes the tasks described in the table below (from the original paper, figure 2):\n\n![table.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363265279-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n\n## Training Procedure\n\nAccording to the model card from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance. There is one fine-tuned Flan model per T5 model size.\n\nThe model has been trained on TPU v3 or TPU v4 pods, using [`t5x`](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) codebase together with [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax).\n\n\n# Evaluation\n\n## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics\n\nThe authors evaluated the model on various tasks covering several languages (1836 in total). See the table below for some quantitative evaluation:\n![image.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1668072995230-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\nFor full details, please check the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf).\n\n## Results \n\nFor full results for FLAN-T5-Large, see the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf), Table 3.\n\n# Environmental Impact\n\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al.

Built upon extensive training, Qwen3 delivers groundbreaking advancements in reasoning, instruction-following, agent capabilities, and multilingual support, with the following key features:\n\n- **Uniquely support of seamless switching between thinking mode** (for complex logical reasoning, math, and coding) and **non-thinking mode** (for efficient, general-purpose dialogue) **within single model**, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.\n- **Significantly enhancement in its reasoning capabilities**, surpassing previous QwQ (in thinking mode) and Qwen2.5 instruct models (in non-thinking mode) on mathematics, code generation, and commonsense logical reasoning.\n- **Superior human preference alignment**, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience.\n- **Expertise in agent capabilities**, enabling precise integration with external tools in both thinking and unthinking modes and achieving leading performance among open-source models in complex agent-based tasks.\n- **Support of 100+ languages and dialects** with strong capabilities for **multilingual instruction following** and **translation**.\n\n## Model Overview\n\n**Qwen3-0.6B** has the following features:\n- Type: Causal Language Models\n- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\n- Number of Parameters: 0.6B\n- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 0.44B\n- Number of Layers: 28\n- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 16 for Q and 8 for KV\n- Context Length: 32,768 \n\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you encounter significant endless repetitions, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section for optimal sampling parameters, and set the ``presence_penalty`` to 1.5.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThe code of Qwen3 has been in the latest Hugging Face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.51.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen3''\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto"\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True # Switches between thinking and non-thinking modes. Default is True.\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n    # rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\n    index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\n    index = 0\n\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")\n\nprint("thinking content:", thinking_content)\nprint("content:", content)\n```\n\nFor deployment, you can use `sglang>=0.4.6.post1` or `vllm>=0.8.5` or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\n- SGLang:\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --reasoning-parser qwen3\n    ```\n- vLLM:\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\n    ```\n\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\n\n## Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The `enable_thinking` switch is also available in APIs created by SGLang and vLLM. \n> Please refer to our documentation for [SGLang](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/sglang.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) and [vLLM](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) users.\n\n### `enable_thinking=True`\n\nBy default, Qwen3 has thinking capabilities enabled, similar to QwQ-32B. This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting `enable_thinking=True` or leaving it as the default value in `tokenizer.apply_chat_template`, the model will engage its thinking mode.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a `<think>...</think>` block, followed by the final response.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For thinking mode, use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0` (the default setting in `generation_config.json`). **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n\n### `enable_thinking=False`\n\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model''s thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For non-thinking mode, we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.

Specifically, you can add `/think` and `/no_think` to user prompts or system messages to switch the model''s thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\n\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nclass QwenChatbot:\n    def __init__(self, model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"):\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.history = []\n\n    def generate_response(self, user_input):\n        messages = self.history + [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]\n\n        text = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tokenize=False,\n            add_generation_prompt=True\n        )\n\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")\n        response_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n        response = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n        # Update history\n        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})\n        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})\n\n        return response\n\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    chatbot = QwenChatbot()\n\n    # First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\n    user_input_1 = "How many r''s in strawberries?"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_1}")\n    response_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_1}")\n    print("----------------------")\n\n    # Second input with /no_think\n    user_input_2 = "Then, how many r''s in blueberries? /no_think"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_2}")\n    response_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_2}") \n    print("----------------------")\n\n    # Third input with /think\n    user_input_3 = "Really? /think"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_3}")\n    response_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_3}")\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For API compatibility, when `enable_thinking=True`, regardless of whether the user uses `/think` or `/no_think`, the model will always output a block wrapped in `<think>...</think>`. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled.\n> When `enable_thinking=False`, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any `/think` or `/no_think` tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n## Agentic Use\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n```python\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n    ''model'': ''Qwen3-0.6B'',\n\n    # Use the endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio:\n    # ''model_type'': ''qwen_dashscope'',\n    # ''api_key'': os.getenv(''DASHSCOPE_API_KEY''),\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    ''model_server'': ''http://localhost:8000/v1'',  # api_base\n    ''api_key'': ''EMPTY'',\n\n    # Other parameters:\n    # ''generate_cfg'': {\n    #         # Add: When the response content is `<think>this is the thought</think>this is the answer;\n    #         # Do not add: When the response has been separated by reasoning_content and content.\n    #         ''thought_in_content'': True,\n    #     },\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {''mcpServers'': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            ''time'': {\n                ''command'': ''uvx'',\n                ''args'': [''mcp-server-time'', ''--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai'']\n            },\n            "fetch": {\n                "command": "uvx",\n                "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  ''code_interpreter'',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{''role'': ''user'', ''content'': ''https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen''}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - For thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`), use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\n   - For non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`), we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\n\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n   - **Math Problems**: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `"answer": "C"`."\n\n4. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\n      title={Qwen3 Technical Report}, \n      author={Qwen Team},\n      year={2025},\n      eprint={2505.09388},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388}, \n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":751632384,"storage_bytes":4522815806,"files_count":10,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Qwen3ForCausalLM"],"model_type":"qwen3","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":null,"chat_template":"{%- if tools %}\n    {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' }}\n    {%- if messages[0].role == ''system'' %}\n        {{- messages[0].content + ''\\n\\n'' }}\n    {%- endif %}\n    {{- \"# Tools\\n\\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\\n\\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\\n<tools>\" }}\n    {%- for tool in tools %}\n        {{- \"\\n\" }}\n        {{- tool | tojson }}\n    {%- endfor %}\n    {{- \"\\n</tools>\\n\\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\\n<tool_call>\\n{\\\"name\\\": <function-name>, \\\"arguments\\\": <args-json-object>}\\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\\n\" }}\n{%- else %}\n    {%- if messages[0].role == ''system'' %}\n        {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' + messages[0].content + ''<|im_end|>\\n'' }}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endif %}\n{%- set ns = namespace(multi_step_tool=true, last_query_index=messages|length -

This is because we use a custom model architecture that is not yet part of the `transformers` package.\n\nIt includes options for many training efficiency features such as [FlashAttention (Dao et al. 2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf), [ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409), QK LayerNorm, and more.\n\n```python\nimport transformers\nmodel = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n  ''mosaicml/mpt-7b-storywriter'',\n  trust_remote_code=True\n)\n```\n\nTo use the optimized [triton implementation](https://github.com/openai/triton) of FlashAttention, you can load the model on GPU (`cuda:0`) with `attn_impl=''triton''` and with `bfloat16` precision:\n```python\nimport torch\nimport transformers\n\nname = ''mosaicml/mpt-7b-storywriter''\n\nconfig = transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained(name, trust_remote_code=True)\nconfig.attn_config[''attn_impl''] = ''triton''\nconfig.init_device = ''cuda:0'' # For fast initialization directly on GPU!\n\nmodel = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n  name,\n  config=config,\n  torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, # Load model weights in bfloat16\n  trust_remote_code=True\n)\n```\n\nAlthough the model was trained with a sequence length of 2048 and finetuned with a sequence length of 65536,\nALiBi enables users to increase the maximum sequence length during finetuning and/or inference. For example:\n```python\nimport transformers\n\nname = ''mosaicml/mpt-7b''\n\nconfig = transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained(name, trust_remote_code=True)\nconfig.max_seq_len = 83968 # (input + output) tokens can now be up to 83968\n\nmodel = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n  name,\n  config=config,\n  trust_remote_code=True\n)\n```\n\nThis model was trained with the [EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) tokenizer.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b")\n```\n\nThe model can then be used, for example, within a text-generation pipeline.  \nNote: when running Torch modules in lower precision, it is best practice to use the [torch.autocast context manager](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html).\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline(''text-generation'', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device=''cuda:0'')\n\nwith torch.autocast(''cuda'', dtype=torch.bfloat16):\n    print(\n        pipe(''Here is a recipe for vegan banana bread:\n'',\n            max_new_tokens=100,\n            do_sample=True,\n            use_cache=True))\n```\n\n## Community-Created Resources\n\nThese were not created by MosaicML, but you may find them useful. These links are not an endorsement of the creators or their content.\n\n- [Oobabooga Running MPT-7B-Storywriter](https://youtu.be/QVVb6Md6huA)\n- [NEW MPT-7B-StoryWriter CRUSHES GPT-4!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Y_ZdsuKWQ&t=649s) - Has a long section on running locally using Oobabooga\n\n## Example Epilogue\n\nThe full text of the _The Great Gatsby_ (67873 tokens) was fed to the model, followed by the text "EPILOGUE"\n\n**TheRealFitzgerald233**:\n\n> ...\n>\n> So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\n>\n> EPILOGUE\n\n**MPT-7B-StoryWriter**:\n\n>I have lived so long in the shadow of this dream that I may never see the bright sunlight of reality.

I had hardly crossed the threshold of the old world when my eye caught the headlines of a newspaper, and I knew at once that my dream was over. I knew that Gatsby was dead.\n>\n>And I knew that day that I didn''t love her.\n>\n>That night I took the last train for West Egg, and when I reached home I went directly to my attic and brought down all Gatsby''s letters.\n>\n>I have sorted them by date and placed them in the order in which they were written.

He had become a great man.\n>\n>And I knew that he had not changed at all.\n\n## Model Description\n\nThe architecture is a modification of a standard decoder-only transformer.\n\nThe model has been modified from a standard transformer in the following ways:\n* It uses [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf)\n* It uses [ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409) and does not use positional embeddings\n* It does not use biases\n\n\n| Hyperparameter | Value |\n|----------------|-------|\n|n_parameters | 6.7B |\n|n_layers | 32 |\n| n_heads | 32 |\n| d_model | 4096 |\n| vocab size | 50432 |\n| sequence length | **65536** |\n\n## PreTraining Data\n\nFor more details on the pretraining process, see [MPT-7B](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b).\n\nThe data was tokenized using the [EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) tokenizer.\n\n### Training Configuration\n\nThis model was trained on 8 A100-80GBs for about 2 days using the [MosaicML Platform](https://www.mosaicml.com/platform).\nThe model was trained with sharded data parallelism using [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html) and used the [LION](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06675) optimizer.\n\n## Limitations and Biases\n\n_The following language is modified from [EleutherAI''s GPT-NeoX-20B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b)_\n\nMPT-7B-StoryWriter can produce factually incorrect output, and should not be relied on to produce factually accurate information.\nMPT-7B-StoryWriter was trained on various public datasets.\nWhile great efforts have been taken to clean the pretraining data, it is possible that this model could generate lewd, biased or otherwise offensive outputs.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis model was finetuned by Alex Trott and the MosaicML NLP team\n\n## MosaicML Platform\n\nIf you''re interested in [training](https://www.mosaicml.com/training) and [deploying](https://www.mosaicml.com/inference) your own MPT or LLMs on the MosaicML Platform, [sign up here](https://forms.mosaicml.com/demo?utm_source=huggingface&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mpt-7b).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe license on this model does not constitute legal advice.

Based on the Transformer architecture, it is a model with 7 billion parameters trained on approximately 1.2 trillion tokens. It supports both Chinese and English, with a context window length of 4096. It achieves the best performance of its size on standard Chinese and English authoritative benchmarks (C-EVAL/MMLU).\n\nIf you wish to use Baichuan-7B (for inference, finetuning, etc.), we recommend using the accompanying code library [Baichuan-7B](https://github.com/baichuan-inc/Baichuan-7B).\n\n## Why use Baichuan-7B\n\n- 在同尺寸模型中Baichuan-7B达到了目前SOTA的水平，参考下面MMLU指标\n- Baichuan-7B使用自有的中英文双语语料进行训练，在中文上进行优化，在C-Eval达到SOTA水平\n- 不同于LLaMA完全禁止商业使用，Baichuan-7B使用更宽松的开源协议，允许用于商业目的\n\n- Among models of the same size, Baichuan-7B has achieved the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) level, as evidenced by the following MMLU metrics.\n- Baichuan-7B is trained on proprietary bilingual Chinese-English corpora, optimized for Chinese, and achieves SOTA performance on C-Eval.\n- Unlike LLaMA, which completely prohibits commercial use, Baichuan-7B employs a more lenient open-source license, allowing for commercial purposes.\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model\n\n如下是一个使用Baichuan-7B进行1-shot推理的任务，根据作品给出作者名，正确输出为"夜雨寄北->李商隐"\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("baichuan-inc/Baichuan-7B", trust_remote_code=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("baichuan-inc/Baichuan-7B", device_map="auto", trust_remote_code=True)\ninputs = tokenizer(''登鹳雀楼->王之涣\n夜雨寄北->'', return_tensors=''pt'')\ninputs = inputs.to(''cuda:0'')\npred = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=64,repetition_penalty=1.1)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(pred.cpu()[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n```\n\nThe following is a task of performing 1-shot inference using Baichuan-7B, where the author''s name is given based on the work, with the correct output being "One Hundred Years of Solitude->Gabriel Garcia Marquez"\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("baichuan-inc/Baichuan-7B", trust_remote_code=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("baichuan-inc/Baichuan-7B", device_map="auto", trust_remote_code=True)\ninputs = tokenizer(''Hamlet->Shakespeare\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude->'', return_tensors=''pt'')\ninputs = inputs.to(''cuda:0'')\npred = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=64,repetition_penalty=1.1)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(pred.cpu()[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n```\n\n## Model Details\n\n### Model Description\n\n<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->\n\n- **Developed by:** 百川智能(Baichuan Intelligent Technology)\n- **Email**: opensource@baichuan-inc.com\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** Chinese/English\n- **License:** [Baichuan-7B License](https://huggingface.co/baichuan-inc/Baichuan-7B/blob/main/baichuan-7B%20%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E8%AE%B8%E5%8F%AF%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE.pdf)\n\n### Model Sources\n\n<!-- Provide the basic links for the model. -->\n\n整体模型基于标准的Transformer结构，我们采用了和LLaMA一样的模型设计\n- **Position Embedding**：采用rotary-embedding，是现阶段被大多数模型采用的位置编码方案，具有很好的外推性。\n- **Feedforward Layer**：采用SwiGLU，Feedforward变化为(8/3)倍的隐含层大小，即11008。\n- **Layer Normalization**: 基于[RMSNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467)的Pre-Normalization。\n\n具体参数和见下表\n| Hyperparameter | Value |\n|----------------|-------|\n|n_parameters | 7000559616 |\n|n_layers | 32 |\n| n_heads | 32 |\n| d_model | 4096 |\n| vocab size | 64000 |\n| sequence length | 4096 |\n\nThe overall model is based on the standard Transformer structure, and we have adopted the same model design as LLaMA:\n\n- Position Embedding: We use rotary-embedding, which is the position encoding scheme adopted by most models at this stage, and it has excellent extrapolation capabilities.\n- Feedforward Layer: We use SwiGLU. The feedforward changes to (8/3) times the size of the hidden layer, that is, 11008.\n- Layer Normalization: Pre-Normalization based on [RMSNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467).\n\nThe specific parameters are as follows:\n| Hyperparameter | Value |\n|----------------|-------|\n|n_parameters | 7000559616 |\n|n_layers | 32 |\n| n_heads | 32 |\n| d_model | 4096 |\n| vocab size | 64000 |\n| sequence length | 4096 |\n\n## Uses\n\n<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->\n\n### Downstream Use \n\n<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->\n我们同时开源出了和本模型配套的训练代码，允许进行高效的Finetune用于下游任务，具体参见[Baichuan-7B](https://github.com/baichuan-inc/Baichuan-7B)。\n\nWe have also open-sourced the training code that accompanies this model, allowing for efficient finetuning for downstream tasks.

If you''re not satisfied with the similarity, try to increase the weight of "IdentityNet Strength" and "Adapter Strength".\n2. If you feel that the saturation is too high, first decrease the Adapter strength. If it is still too high, then decrease the IdentityNet strength.\n3. If you find that text control is not as expected, decrease Adapter strength.\n4. If you find that realistic style is not good enough, go for our Github repo and use a more realistic base model.\n\n## Demos\n\n<div  align="center">\n<img src=''examples/0.png''>\n</div>\n\n<div  align="center">\n<img src=''examples/1.png''>\n</div>\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis project is released under Apache License and aims to positively impact the field of AI-driven image generation.

We will release 768p video checkpoint in a few days.\n\n* `2024.10.11`  🤗🤗🤗 [Hugging Face demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Pyramid-Flow/pyramid-flow) is available. Thanks [@multimodalart](https://huggingface.co/multimodalart) for the commit! \n\n* `2024.10.10`  🚀🚀🚀 We release the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05954), [project page](https://pyramid-flow.github.io) and [model checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/pyramid-flow-sd3) of Pyramid Flow.\n\n## Installation\n\nWe recommend setting up the environment with conda. The codebase currently uses Python 3.8.10 and PyTorch 2.1.2, and we are actively working to support a wider range of versions.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow\ncd Pyramid-Flow\n\n# create env using conda\nconda create -n pyramid python==3.8.10\nconda activate pyramid\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nThen, download the model from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/rain1011) (there are two variants: [miniFLUX](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/pyramid-flow-miniflux) or [SD3](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/pyramid-flow-sd3)). The miniFLUX models support 1024p image and 384p video generation, and the SD3-based models support 768p and 384p video generation. The 384p checkpoint generates 5-second video at 24FPS, while the 768p checkpoint generates up to 10-second video at 24FPS.\n\n```python\nfrom huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n\nmodel_path = ''PATH''   # The local directory to save downloaded checkpoint\nsnapshot_download("rain1011/pyramid-flow-sd3", local_dir=model_path, local_dir_use_symlinks=False, repo_type=''model'')\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFor inference, we provide Gradio demo, single-GPU, multi-GPU, and Apple Silicon inference code, as well as VRAM-efficient features such as CPU offloading. Please check our [code repository](https://github.com/jy0205/Pyramid-Flow?tab=readme-ov-file#inference) for usage.\n\nBelow is a simplified two-step usage procedure. First, load the downloaded model:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom pyramid_dit import PyramidDiTForVideoGeneration\nfrom diffusers.utils import load_image, export_to_video\n\ntorch.cuda.set_device(0)\nmodel_dtype, torch_dtype = ''bf16'', torch.bfloat16   # Use bf16 (not support fp16 yet)\n\nmodel = PyramidDiTForVideoGeneration(\n    ''PATH'',                                         # The downloaded checkpoint dir\n    model_dtype,\n    model_variant=''diffusion_transformer_768p'',     # ''diffusion_transformer_384p''\n)\n\nmodel.vae.enable_tiling()\n# model.vae.to("cuda")\n# model.dit.to("cuda")\n# model.text_encoder.to("cuda")\n\n# if you''re not using sequential offloading bellow uncomment the lines above ^\nmodel.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()\n```\n\nThen, you can try text-to-video generation on your own prompts:\n\n```python\nprompt = "A movie trailer featuring the adventures of the 30 year old space man wearing a red wool knitted motorcycle helmet, blue sky, salt desert, cinematic style, shot on 35mm film, vivid colors"\n\nwith torch.no_grad(), torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch_dtype):\n    frames = model.generate(\n        prompt=prompt,\n        num_inference_steps=[20, 20, 20],\n        video_num_inference_steps=[10, 10, 10],\n        height=768,     \n        width=1280,\n        temp=16,                    # temp=16: 5s, temp=31: 10s\n        guidance_scale=9.0,         # The guidance for the first frame, set it to 7 for 384p variant\n        video_guidance_scale=5.0,   # The guidance for the other video latent\n        output_type="pil",\n        save_memory=True,           # If you have enough GPU memory, set it to `False` to improve vae decoding speed\n    )\n\nexport_to_video(frames, "./text_to_video_sample.mp4", fps=24)\n```\n\nAs an autoregressive model, our model also supports (text conditioned) image-to-video generation:\n\n```python\nimage = Image.open(''assets/the_great_wall.jpg'').convert("RGB").resize((1280, 768))\nprompt = "FPV flying over the Great Wall"\n\nwith torch.no_grad(), torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch_dtype):\n    frames = model.generate_i2v(\n        prompt=prompt,\n        input_image=image,\n        num_inference_steps=[10, 10, 10],\n        temp=16,\n        video_guidance_scale=4.0,\n        output_type="pil",\n        save_memory=True,           # If you have enough GPU memory, set it to `False` to improve vae decoding speed\n    )\n\nexport_to_video(frames, "./image_to_video_sample.mp4", fps=24)\n```\n\n## Usage tips\n\n* The `guidance_scale` parameter controls the visual quality. We suggest using a guidance within [7, 9] for the 768p checkpoint during text-to-video generation, and 7 for the 384p checkpoint.\n* The `video_guidance_scale` parameter controls the motion. A larger value increases the dynamic degree and mitigates the autoregressive generation degradation, while a smaller value stabilizes the video.\n* For 10-second video generation, we recommend using a guidance scale of 7 and a video guidance scale of 5.\n\n## Gallery\n\nThe following video examples are generated at 5s, 768p, 24fps.

This dataset consists of instruction-answer pairs instead of code completion examples, making it structurally different from HumanEval. LoRA was not used -- both models are a native finetune. We used DeepSpeed ZeRO 3 and Flash Attention 2 to train these models in 15 hours on 32 A100-80GB GPUs.

SmolLM3 is a fully open model that offers strong performance at the 3B–4B scale.\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6200d0a443eb0913fa2df7cc/db3az7eGzs-Sb-8yUj-ff.png)\n\nThe model is a decoder-only transformer using GQA and NoPE (with 3:1 ratio), it was pretrained on 11.2T tokens with a staged curriculum of web, code, math and reasoning data. Post-training included midtraining on 140B reasoning tokens followed by supervised fine-tuning and alignment via Anchored Preference Optimization (APO).\n\n### Key features\n- Instruct model optimized for **hybrid reasoning**\n- **Fully open model**: open weights + full training details including public data mixture and training configs\n- **Long context:** Trained on 64k context and supports up to **128k tokens** using YARN extrapolation\n- **Multilingual**: 6 natively supported (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese)\n\nFor more details refer to our blog post: https://hf.co/blog/smollm3\n\n## How to use\n\nThe modeling code for SmolLM3 is available in transformers `v4.53.0`, so make sure to upgrade your transformers version. You can also load the model with the latest `vllm` which uses transformers as a backend.\n```bash\npip install -U transformers\n```\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B"\ndevice = "cuda"  # for GPU usage or "cpu" for CPU usage\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n).to(device)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = "Give me a brief explanation of gravity in simple terms."\nmessages_think = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\n\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages_think,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\n# Generate the output\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)\n\n# Get and decode the output\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]) :]\nprint(tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True))\n```\n\n>[!TIP]\n> We recommend setting `temperature=0.6` and `top_p=0.95` in the sampling parameters.\n\n### Long context processing\n\nThe current `config.json` is set for context length up to 65,536 tokens. To handle longer inputs (128k or 256k), we utilize YaRN you can change the `max_position_embeddings` and rope_scaling` to:\n```\n{\n  ...,\n  "rope_scaling": {\n    "factor": 2.0, #2x65536=131 072 \n    "original_max_position_embeddings": 65536,\n    "type": "yarn"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Enabling and Disabling Extended Thinking Mode\n\nWe enable extended thinking by default, so the example above generates the output with a reasoning trace. For choosing between enabling, you can provide the `/think` and `/no_think` flags through the system prompt as shown in the snippet below for extended thinking disabled. The code for generating the response with extended thinking would be the same except that the system prompt should have `/think` instead of `/no_think`.\n\n```python\nprompt = "Give me a brief explanation of gravity in simple terms."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": "/no_think"},\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\n\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n)\n```\n\nWe also provide the option of specifying the whether to use extended thinking through the `enable_thinking` kwarg as in the example below. You do not need to set the `/no_think` or `/think` flags through the system prompt if using the kwarg, but keep in mind that the flag in the system prompt overwrites the setting in the kwarg.\n\n```python\nprompt = "Give me a brief explanation of gravity in simple terms."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\n\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=False\n)\n```\n\n### Agentic Usage\n\nSmolLM3 supports tool calling!\nJust pass your list of tools:\n- Under the argument `xml_tools` for standard tool-calling: these tools will be called as JSON blobs within XML tags, like `<tool_call>{"name": "get_weather", "arguments": {"city": "Copenhagen"}}</tool_call>`\n- Or under `python_tools`: then the model will call tools like python functions in a `<code>` snippet, like `<code>get_weather(city="Copenhagen")</code>`\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ncheckpoint = "HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\n\ntools = [\n    {\n        "name": "get_weather",\n        "description": "Get the weather in a city",\n        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"city": {"type": "string", "description": "The city to get the weather for"}}}}\n]\n\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": "Hello! How is the weather today in Copenhagen?"\n    }\n]\n\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    enable_thinking=False, # True works as well, your choice!\n    xml_tools=tools,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    tokenize=True,\n    return_tensors="pt"\n)\n\noutputs = model.generate(inputs)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n### Using Custom System Instructions. \n\nYou can specify custom instruction through the system prompt while controlling whether to use extended thinking. For example, the snippet below shows how to make the model speak like a pirate while enabling extended thinking.\n\n```python\nprompt = "Give me a brief explanation of gravity in simple terms."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": "Speak like a pirate./think"},\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\n\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n)\n```\n\nFor local inference, you can use `llama.cpp`, `ONNX`, `MLX`, `MLC` and `ExecuTorch`. You can find quantized checkpoints in this collection (https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceTB/smollm3-686d33c1fdffe8e635317e23)\n\n### vLLM and SGLang\n\nYou can use vLLM and SGLang to deploy the model in an API compatible with OpenAI format.\n\n#### SGLang\n\n```bash\npython -m sglang.launch_server --model-path HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B\n```\n\n#### vLLM\n\n```bash\nvllm serve HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser=hermes\n```\n\n#### Setting `chat_template_kwargs`\n\nYou can specify `chat_template_kwargs` such as `enable_thinking` to a deployed model by passing the `chat_template_kwargs` parameter in the API request.\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d ''{\n  "model": "HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B",\n  "messages": [\n    {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a brief explanation of gravity in simple terms."}\n  ],\n  "temperature": 0.6,\n  "top_p": 0.95,\n  "max_tokens": 16384,\n  "chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}\n}''\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn this section, we report the evaluation results of SmolLM3 model.

Your role as an assistant involves thoroughly exploring questions through a systematic thinking process before providing the final precise and accurate solutions. This requires engaging in a comprehensive cycle of analysis, summarizing, exploration, reassessment, reflection, backtracking, and iteration to develop well-considered thinking process. Please structure your response into two main sections: Thought and Solution using the specified format: <think> Thought section </think> Solution section. In the Thought section, detail your reasoning process in steps.

Introduction\n\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\n\n**NOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the [Usage Recommendation](#usage-recommendations) section.**\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="80%" src="figures/benchmark.jpg">\n</p>\n\n## 2. Model Summary\n\n---\n\n**Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model**\n\n-  We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\n\n-   We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model''s reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\n    We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models. \n\n---\n\n**Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too**\n\n-  We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \n- Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\n## 3.

How to Run Locally\n\n### DeepSeek-R1 Models\n\nPlease visit [DeepSeek-V3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\n\n**NOTE: Hugging Face''s Transformers has not been directly supported yet.**\n\n### DeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\n\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm):\n\n```shell\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\n```\n\nYou can also easily start a service using [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)\n\n```bash\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n```\n\n### Usage Recommendations\n\n**We recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:**\n\n1. Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\n2. **Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.**\n3. For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."\n4. When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\n\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting "\<think\>\n\n\</think\>") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model''s performance.\n**To ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with "\<think\>\n" at the beginning of every output.**\n\n## 7.

Built upon extensive training, Qwen3 delivers groundbreaking advancements in reasoning, instruction-following, agent capabilities, and multilingual support, with the following key features:\n\n- **Uniquely support of seamless switching between thinking mode** (for complex logical reasoning, math, and coding) and **non-thinking mode** (for efficient, general-purpose dialogue) **within single model**, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.\n- **Significantly enhancement in its reasoning capabilities**, surpassing previous QwQ (in thinking mode) and Qwen2.5 instruct models (in non-thinking mode) on mathematics, code generation, and commonsense logical reasoning.\n- **Superior human preference alignment**, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience.\n- **Expertise in agent capabilities**, enabling precise integration with external tools in both thinking and unthinking modes and achieving leading performance among open-source models in complex agent-based tasks.\n- **Support of 100+ languages and dialects** with strong capabilities for **multilingual instruction following** and **translation**.\n\n## Model Overview\n\n**Qwen3-30B-A3B** has the following features:\n- Type: Causal Language Models\n- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\n- Number of Parameters: 30.5B in total and 3.3B activated\n- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 29.9B\n- Number of Layers: 48\n- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 32 for Q and 4 for KV\n- Number of Experts: 128\n- Number of Activated Experts: 8\n- Context Length: 32,768 natively and [131,072 tokens with YaRN](#processing-long-texts). \n\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThe code of Qwen3-MoE has been in the latest Hugging Face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.51.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen3_moe''\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto"\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True # Switches between thinking and non-thinking modes. Default is True.\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n    # rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\n    index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\n    index = 0\n\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")\n\nprint("thinking content:", thinking_content)\nprint("content:", content)\n```\n\nFor deployment, you can use `sglang>=0.4.6.post1` or `vllm>=0.8.5` or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\n- SGLang:\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B --reasoning-parser qwen3\n    ```\n- vLLM:\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\n    ```\n\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\n\n## Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The `enable_thinking` switch is also available in APIs created by SGLang and vLLM. \n> Please refer to our documentation for [SGLang](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/sglang.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) and [vLLM](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) users.\n\n### `enable_thinking=True`\n\nBy default, Qwen3 has thinking capabilities enabled, similar to QwQ-32B. This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting `enable_thinking=True` or leaving it as the default value in `tokenizer.apply_chat_template`, the model will engage its thinking mode.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a `<think>...</think>` block, followed by the final response.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For thinking mode, use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0` (the default setting in `generation_config.json`). **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n\n### `enable_thinking=False`\n\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model''s thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For non-thinking mode, we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n### Advanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input\n\nWe provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model''s behavior when `enable_thinking=True`. Specifically, you can add `/think` and `/no_think` to user prompts or system messages to switch the model''s thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\n\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nclass QwenChatbot:\n    def __init__(self, model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B"):\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.history = []\n\n    def generate_response(self, user_input):\n        messages = self.history + [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]\n\n        text = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tokenize=False,\n            add_generation_prompt=True\n        )\n\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")\n        response_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n        response = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n        # Update history\n        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})\n        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})\n\n        return response\n\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    chatbot = QwenChatbot()\n\n    # First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\n    user_input_1 = "How many r''s in strawberries?"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_1}")\n    response_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_1}")\n    print("----------------------")\n\n    # Second input with /no_think\n    user_input_2 = "Then, how many r''s in blueberries? /no_think"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_2}")\n    response_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_2}") \n    print("----------------------")\n\n    # Third input with /think\n    user_input_3 = "Really? /think"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_3}")\n    response_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_3}")\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For API compatibility, when `enable_thinking=True`, regardless of whether the user uses `/think` or `/no_think`, the model will always output a block wrapped in `<think>...</think>`. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled.\n> When `enable_thinking=False`, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any `/think` or `/no_think` tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n## Agentic Use\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n```python\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n    ''model'': ''Qwen3-30B-A3B'',\n\n    # Use the endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio:\n    # ''model_type'': ''qwen_dashscope'',\n    # ''api_key'': os.getenv(''DASHSCOPE_API_KEY''),\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    ''model_server'': ''http://localhost:8000/v1'',  # api_base\n    ''api_key'': ''EMPTY'',\n\n    # Other parameters:\n    # ''generate_cfg'': {\n    #         # Add: When the response content is `<think>this is the thought</think>this is the answer;\n    #         # Do not add: When the response has been separated by reasoning_content and content.\n    #         ''thought_in_content'': True,\n    #     },\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {''mcpServers'': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            ''time'': {\n                ''command'': ''uvx'',\n                ''args'': [''mcp-server-time'', ''--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai'']\n            },\n            "fetch": {\n                "command": "uvx",\n                "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  ''code_interpreter'',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{''role'': ''user'', ''content'': ''https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen''}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n## Processing Long Texts\n\nQwen3 natively supports context lengths of up to 32,768 tokens. For conversations where the total length (including both input and output) significantly exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively. We have validated the model''s performance on context lengths of up to 131,072 tokens using the [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071) method.\n\nYaRN is currently supported by several inference frameworks, e.g., `transformers` and `llama.cpp` for local use, `vllm` and `sglang` for deployment. In general, there are two approaches to enabling YaRN for supported frameworks:\n\n- Modifying the model files:\n  In the `config.json` file, add the `rope_scaling` fields:\n    ```json\n    {\n        ...,\n        "rope_scaling": {\n            "rope_type": "yarn",\n            "factor": 4.0,\n            "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n  For `llama.cpp`, you need to regenerate the GGUF file after the modification.\n\n- Passing command line arguments:\n\n  For `vllm`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve ... --rope-scaling ''{"rope_type":"yarn","factor":4.0,"original_max_position_embeddings":32768}'' --max-model-len 131072\n    ```\n\n  For `sglang`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server ... --json-model-override-args ''{"rope_scaling":{"rope_type":"yarn","factor":4.0,"original_max_position_embeddings":32768}}''\n    ```\n\n  For `llama-server` from `llama.cpp`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    llama-server ... --rope-scaling yarn --rope-scale 4 --yarn-orig-ctx 32768\n    ```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you encounter the following warning\n> ```\n> Unrecognized keys in `rope_scaling` for ''rope_type''=''yarn'': {''original_max_position_embeddings''}\n> ```\n> please upgrade `transformers>=4.51.0`.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> All the notable open-source frameworks implement static YaRN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.**\n> We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required. \n> It is also recommended to modify the `factor` as needed. For example, if the typical context length for your application is 65,536 tokens, it would be better to set `factor` as 2.0. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The default `max_position_embeddings` in `config.json` is set to 40,960. This allocation includes reserving 32,768 tokens for outputs and 8,192 tokens for typical prompts, which is sufficient for most scenarios involving short text processing. If the average context length does not exceed 32,768 tokens, we do not recommend enabling YaRN in this scenario, as it may potentially degrade model performance.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio supports dynamic YaRN by default and no extra configuration is needed.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - For thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`), use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\n   - For non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`), we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\n\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n   - **Math Problems**: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `"answer": "C"`."\n\n4. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\n      title={Qwen3 Technical Report}, \n      author={Qwen Team},\n      year={2025},\n      eprint={2505.09388},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388}, \n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":30532122624,"storage_bytes":61077998302,"files_count":26,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Qwen3MoeForCausalLM"],"model_type":"qwen3_moe","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":null,"chat_template":"{%- if tools %}\n    {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' }}\n    {%- if messages[0].role == ''system'' %}\n        {{- messages[0].content + ''\\n\\n'' }}\n    {%- endif %}\n    {{- \"# Tools\\n\\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\\n\\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\\n<tools>\" }}\n    {%- for tool in tools %}\n        {{- \"\\n\" }}\n        {{- tool | tojson }}\n    {%- endfor %}\n    {{- \"\\n</tools>\\n\\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\\n<tool_call>\\n{\\\"name\\\": <function-name>, \\\"arguments\\\": <args-json-object>}\\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\\n\" }}\n{%- else %}\n    {%- if messages[0].role == ''system'' %}\n        {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' + messages[0].content + ''<|im_end|>\\n'' }}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endif %}\n{%- set ns = namespace(multi_step_tool=true, last_query_index=messages|length -

However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner. Code, models, and datasets are released.*\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use this model for conditional and un-conditional image captioning\n\n### Using the Pytorch model\n\n#### Running the model on CPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration\n\nprocessor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")\nmodel = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")\n\nimg_url = ''https://storage.googleapis.com/sfr-vision-language-research/BLIP/demo.jpg'' \nraw_image = Image.open(requests.get(img_url, stream=True).raw).convert(''RGB'')\n\n# conditional image captioning\ntext = "a photography of"\ninputs = processor(raw_image, text, return_tensors="pt")\n\nout = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n# >>> a photography of a woman and her dog\n\n# unconditional image captioning\ninputs = processor(raw_image, return_tensors="pt")\n\nout = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n>>> a woman sitting on the beach with her dog\n```\n</details>\n\n#### Running the model on GPU\n\n##### In full precision \n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration\n\nprocessor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")\nmodel = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base").to("cuda")\n\nimg_url = ''https://storage.googleapis.com/sfr-vision-language-research/BLIP/demo.jpg'' \nraw_image = Image.open(requests.get(img_url, stream=True).raw).convert(''RGB'')\n\n# conditional image captioning\ntext = "a photography of"\ninputs = processor(raw_image, text, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")\n\nout = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n# >>> a photography of a woman and her dog\n\n# unconditional image captioning\ninputs = processor(raw_image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")\n\nout = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n>>> a woman sitting on the beach with her dog\n```\n</details>\n\n##### In half precision (`float16`)\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration\n\nprocessor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")\nmodel = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base", torch_dtype=torch.float16).to("cuda")\n\nimg_url = ''https://storage.googleapis.com/sfr-vision-language-research/BLIP/demo.jpg'' \nraw_image = Image.open(requests.get(img_url, stream=True).raw).convert(''RGB'')\n\n# conditional image captioning\ntext = "a photography of"\ninputs = processor(raw_image, text, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda", torch.float16)\n\nout = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n# >>> a photography of a woman and her dog\n\n# unconditional image captioning\ninputs = processor(raw_image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda", torch.float16)\n\nout = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n>>> a woman sitting on the beach with her dog\n```\n</details>\n\n## Ethical Considerations\nThis release is for research purposes only in support of an academic paper.

"neg":List[str], "prompt": str}\n```\n\n`query` is the query, and `pos` is a list of positive texts, `neg` is a list of negative texts, `prompt` indicates the relationship between query and texts. If you have no negative texts for a query, you can random sample some from the entire corpus as the negatives.\n\nSee

On RTX 4090, end-to-end generation time is reduced by 75%, and a single RTX 4090 can generate videos within 75 seconds. The step-distilled model maintains comparable quality to the original model while achieving significant speedup. See [Step Distillation Comparison](./assets/step_distillation_comparison.md) for detailed quality comparisons. For even faster generation, you can also try 4 steps (faster speed with slightly reduced quality). **To enable the step-distilled model, run `generate.py` with the `--enable_step_distill` parameter.** See [Usage](#-usage) for detailed usage instructions. 🔥🔥🔥🆕\n* 📚 Dec 05, 2025: **Training Code Released**: We now open-source the training code for HunyuanVideo-1.5!

This achievement is built upon several key components, including meticulous data curation, an advanced DiT architecture with selective and sliding tile attention(SSTA), enhanced bilingual understanding through glyph-aware text encoding , progressive pre-training and post-training, and an efficient video super-resolution network. Leveraging these designs, we developed a unified framework capable of high-quality text-to-video and image-to-video generation across multiple durations and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this compact and proficient model establishes a new state-of-the-art among open-source models. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanVideo-1.5, we provide the community with a high-performance foundation that significantly lowers the cost of video creation and research, making advanced video generation more accessible to all.\n\n\n## ✨ Key Features\n- **Lightweight High-Performance Architecture**: We propose an efficient architecture that integrates an 8.3B-parameter Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with a 3D causal VAE, achieving compression ratios of 16× in spatial dimensions and 4× along the temporal axis. Additionally, the innovative SSTA (Selective and Sliding Tile Attention) mechanism prunes redundant spatiotemporal kv blocks, significantly reduces computational overhead for long video sequences and accelerates inference, achieving an end-to-end speedup of $1.87 \times$ in 10-second 720p video synthesis compared to FlashAttention-3.\n\n<div align="center">\n<img src="./assets/hy_video_1_5_dit.png" alt="HunyuanVideo-1.5 DiT" width="600">\n</div> \n\n\n- **Video Super-Resolution Enhancement**: We develop an efficient few-step super-resolution network that upscales outputs to 1080p. It enhances sharpness while correcting distortions, thereby refining details and overall visual texture.\n\n<div align="center">\n<img src="./assets/hy_video_1_5_vsr.png" alt="HunyuanVideo-1.5 VSR" width="600">\n</div> \n\n- **End-to-End Training Optimization**: This work employs a multi-stage, progressive training strategy covering the entire pipeline from pre-training to post-training. Combined with the Muon optimizer to accelerate convergence, this approach holistically refines motion coherence, aesthetic quality, and human preference alignment, achieving professional-grade content generation.\n\n## 📜 System Requirements\n\n### Hardware Requirements\n\n- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support\n- **Minimum GPU Memory**: 14 GB (with model offloading enabled)\n  \n  > **Note:** The memory requirements above are measured with model offloading enabled.

By writing longer and more detailed prompts, the generated video will be significantly improved. We encourage you to craft comprehensive and descriptive prompts to achieve the best possible video quality. we recommend community partners consulting our official guide on how to write effective prompts. \n\n**Reference:** **[HunyuanVideo-1.5 Prompt Handbook](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanVideo-1.5/blob/main/assets/HunyuanVideo_1_5_Prompt_Handbook_EN.md)**\n\n### System Prompts for Automatic Prompt Enhancement\nFor users seeking to optimize prompts for other large models, it is recommended to consult the definition of `t2v_rewrite_system_prompt` in the file `hyvideo/utils/rewrite/t2v_prompt.py` to guide text-to-video rewriting. Similarly, for image-to-video rewriting, refer to the definition of `i2v_rewrite_system_prompt` in `hyvideo/utils/rewrite/i2v_prompt.py`.\n\n## 🔑 Inference\n\n### Inference with Source Code\n\n\nFor prompt rewriting, we recommend using Gemini or models deployed via vLLM. This codebase currently only supports models compatible with the vLLM API. If you wish to use Gemini, you will need to implement your own interface calls.\n\nFor models with a vLLM API, note that T2V (text-to-video) and I2V (image-to-video) have different recommended models and environment variables:\n\n- T2V: use [Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507), configure `T2V_REWRITE_BASE_URL` and `T2V_REWRITE_MODEL_NAME`\n- I2V: use [Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct), configure `I2V_REWRITE_BASE_URL` and `I2V_REWRITE_MODEL_NAME`\n\n> You may set the above model names to any other vLLM-compatible models you have deployed (including HuggingFace models).  \n> Rewriting is enabled by default (`--rewrite` defaults to `true`); to disable it explicitly, use `--rewrite false` or `--rewrite 0`. If no vLLM endpoint is configured, the pipeline runs without remote rewriting.\n\nExample: Generate a video (works for both T2V and I2V; set `IMAGE_PATH=none` for T2V or provide an image path for I2V)\n\n> 💡 **Tip**: For faster inference speed, you can enable the step-distilled model using the `--enable_step_distill` parameter. The step-distilled model (480p I2V) can generate videos in 8 or 12 steps (recommended), achieving up to 75% speedup on RTX 4090 while maintaining comparable quality.\n>\n> **Tips:** If your GPU memory is > 14GB but you encounter OOM (Out of Memory) errors during generation, you can try setting the following environment variable before running:\n> ```bash\n> export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True,max_split_size_mb:128\n> ```\n> \n> **Tips:** If you have limited CPU memory and encounter OOM during inference, you can try disable overlapped group offloading by adding the following argument:\n> ```bash\n> --overlap_group_offloading false\n> ```\n\n```bash\nexport T2V_REWRITE_BASE_URL="<your_vllm_server_base_url>"\nexport T2V_REWRITE_MODEL_NAME="<your_model_name>"\nexport I2V_REWRITE_BASE_URL="<your_vllm_server_base_url>"\nexport I2V_REWRITE_MODEL_NAME="<your_model_name>"\n\nPROMPT=''A girl holding a paper with words "Hello, world!"''\n\nIMAGE_PATH=/path/to/image.png # Optional, none or <image path> to enable i2v mode\nSEED=1\nASPECT_RATIO=16:9\nRESOLUTION=480p\nOUTPUT_PATH=./outputs/output.mp4\nMODEL_PATH=./ckpts # Path to pretrained model\n\n# Configuration for faster inference\nN_INFERENCE_GPU=8 # Parallel inference GPU count\nCFG_DISTILLED=true # Inference with CFG distilled model, 2x speedup\nSAGE_ATTN=true # Inference with SageAttention\nSPARSE_ATTN=false # Inference with sparse attention (only 720p models are equipped with sparse attention).

For image-to-video generation, the evaluation encompasses image-video consistency, instruction responsiveness, visual quality, structural stability, and motion effects.\n\n<div align="center">\n<img src="./assets/T2V_Rating.png" alt="rating result of t2v" width="800">\n</div> \n\n---\n\n<div align="center">\n<img src="./assets/I2V_Rating.png" alt="rating result of i2v" width="800">\n</div> \n\n\n### GSB\nThe GSB(Good/Same/Bad) approach is widely used to evaluate the relative performance of two models based on overall video perception quality.We carefully construct 300 diverse text prompts and 300 image samples to cover balanced application scenarios for both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. For each prompt or image input, an equal number of video samples are generated by each model in a single run to ensure comparability. To maintain fairness, inference is performed only once per input without any cherry-picking of results. All competing models are evaluated using their default configurations. The evaluation is conducted by over 100 professional assessors\n\n<div align="center">\n<img src="./assets/T2V_GSB.png" alt="gsb result of t2v" width="800">\n</div>\n\n---\n\n<div align="center">\n<img src="./assets/I2V_GSB.png" alt="gsb result of i2v" width="800">\n</div> \n\n\n### Inference speed\nWe report inference speed with basic engineering-level acceleration techniques enabled on 8 H800 GPUs to demonstrate practical performance achievable in real-world deployment scenarios.\nPlease note that in this experiment, we do not pursue the most extreme acceleration at the cost of generation quality, but rather to achieve notable speed improvements while maintaining nearly identical output quality.\n\nWe report the total inference time for 50 diffusion steps for HunyuanVideo 1.5 below:\n\n<div align="center">\n<img src="./assets/speed.png" alt="" width="100%">\n</div> \n\n## 🎬 More Examples\n|Features|Demo1|Demo2|\n|------|------|------|\n|Strong Instruction Following|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdc3c27b-69f5-46a1-b707-0b57510fa32f" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```一名哀伤的黑发中国女子凝望天空，复古胶片风格烘托出怀旧戏剧氛围``` </details> <details><summary>📋 Show rewrite prompt</summary> ```俯视角度，一位有着深色，略带凌乱的长卷发的年轻中国女性，佩戴着闪耀的珍珠项链和圆形金色耳环，她凌乱的头发被风吹散，她微微抬头，望向天空，神情十分哀伤，眼中含着泪水。嘴唇涂着红色口红。背景是带有华丽红色花纹的图案。画面呈现复古电影风格，色调低饱和，带着轻微柔焦，烘托情绪氛围，质感仿佛20世纪90年代的经典胶片风格，营造出怀旧且富有戏剧性的感觉。``` </details>|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fcb42cc-cdd3-4651-86a6-645a858561c4" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```建筑蓝图上的线条化为实体，瞬间生长出一个完整的复古工业风办公空间。``` </details> <details><summary>📋 Show rewrite prompt</summary> ```一座空旷的现代阁楼里，有一张铺展在地板中央的建筑蓝图。忽然间，图纸上的线条泛起微光，仿佛被某种无形的力量唤醒。紧接着，那些发光的线条开始向上延伸，从平面中挣脱，勾勒出立体的轮廓——就像在空中进行一场无声的3D打印。随后，奇迹在加速发生：极简的橡木办公桌、优雅的伊姆斯风格皮质椅、高挑的工业风金属书架，还有几盏爱迪生灯泡，以光纹为骨架迅速“生长”出来。转瞬间，线条被真实的材质填充——木材的温润、皮革的质感、金属的冷静，都在眨眼间完整呈现。最终，所有家具稳固落地，蓝图的光芒悄然褪去。一个完整的办公空间，就这样从二维的图纸中诞生。``` </details>|\n|Smooth Motion Generation|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/447847f0-490a-45f9-a86d-a67ab1ff4231" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```A DJ is immersed in his musical world.

The main leaf, a vibrant, deep green, is positioned diagonally across the frame. Its surface is covered in tiny, glistening spherical dewdrops that catch and refract the bright morning sunlight, creating sparkling highlights. Initially, a larger, perfectly round dewdrop clings to the upper section of the leaf, its surface tension holding it in place. Then, as the leaf sways almost imperceptibly, the dewdrop begins to slowly dislodge. Next, it starts to trickle down the central vein of the leaf, its shape elongating slightly as it moves, leaving a subtle, glistening wet trail in its path. Finally, it reaches the pointed tip of the leaf, hangs for a brief moment, and falls out of the bottom of the frame. In the background, other leaves and blades of grass are softly blurred, creating a beautiful bokeh effect with soft, out-of-focus circles of light. The environment is bathed in the warm, golden glow of early morning sunlight, which streams in from behind the leaves, backlighting them and causing their wet edges to shine brilliantly. The overall impression is one of serene, natural beauty, captured in a highly realistic and detailed manner. This is a macro shot. The camera tilts down very slowly, following the path of the main dewdrop as it travels down the leaf. The lighting is soft and natural, with strong backlighting to create a radiant, glowing effect on the dewdrops and leaf edges, characteristic of professional nature photography.

On a flat, laid-out sheet of off-white Chinese Xuan paper with a subtle, fibrous texture, the scene unfolds. Initially, a single, concentrated drop of deep black ink falls into a clear, wet area at the center of the paper. Then, the ink instantly begins to bloom outwards in intricate, flowing tendrils of varying shades from jet-black to smoky grey. As it spreads, the ink wash naturally and rapidly forms the silhouette of a majestic mountain range with sharp, defined peaks. Next, softer, diluted grey tones billow around the mountains, creating layers of atmospheric mist and clouds, while a simple, dark stroke materializes as a lone boat on a tranquil, watery expanse at the base. As the landscape is formed, the ink elements—the lines of the mountains, wisps of cloud, and the shape of the boat—begin to deconstruct, dissolving into flowing streams of liquid ink. Finally, these streams move gracefully across the paper''s empty white space, converging and elegantly reorganizing to form the text "Hunyuan Video 1.5" in a fluid, semi-cursive calligraphic style. The background is the minimalist expanse of the Xuan paper itself, its texture providing a subtle depth. The entire process is lit by soft, even, diffused light from above, which enhances the rich tonal variations of the ink and the delicate texture of the paper without creating harsh shadows. Bird''s-eye view. The camera is positioned directly above the subject, capturing the entire process. The camera remains static.

A sophisticated woman with dark hair tied back elegantly stands in the mid-ground. She is wearing a simple, black silk sleeveless dress and holds a clear, crystal wine glass in her right hand. She is positioned before a large, baroque-style oil painting in an ornate, gilded frame. Inside the painting, an aristocratic man with a mustache, dressed in a dark velvet doublet with a white lace collar, is depicted. His form is defined by visible, impasto oil brushstrokes. Initially, the woman watches the painting with calm poise. Then, the painted man''s arm slowly animates, his painted texture retained as he lifts a dark bottle. Next, a photorealistic stream of red wine emerges directly from the flat canvas surface, arcing through the air and splashing gently into the real crystal glass she holds. She remains perfectly still, accepting the impossible pour with a subtle, knowing smile. The setting is a modern art gallery with high white walls and polished dark concrete floors that reflect the ambient light. Focused track lighting from the high ceiling casts a warm, dramatic spotlight on the woman and the painting, creating soft shadows.

A male hand with visible, realistic skin texture is wrapped firmly around the middle of an intact, pristine red and white aluminum soda can. The can, covered in glistening condensation droplets, rests on a dark, polished wooden surface. The cinematic realism captures every minute detail of the scene. Initially, the hand''s grip is steady, with the can''s cylindrical shape perfectly preserved. Then, the fingers begin to tighten slowly, the knuckles whitening slightly from the exertion. Next, the smooth aluminum surface starts to buckle under the controlled pressure, a sharp crease forming vertically down its side as the metallic sheen distorts. As the hand continues its deliberate squeeze, the can collapses inward progressively, the vibrant red paint wrinkling as the metal structure crumples. Finally, the can is left significantly crushed, its form now an irregular, crumpled shape held tightly in the fist. The scene takes place on a dark, polished wooden tabletop that catches soft, diffuse reflections. The grain of the wood is faintly discernible, adding a layer of texture to the foreground. The background is completely out of focus, rendered as a soft, dark, and non-descript blur, which isolates the main action and enhances the photorealistic quality of the shot.

She wears a simple pink clay dress with a white collar. In her left hand, she carries a small handbag molded from bright red and blue clay, which swings in a slightly jerky arc as she moves. Initially, the girl lifts her right leg high, her body momentarily suspended in a classic stop-motion pose. Then, she hops forward, landing lightly as her left leg swings through for the next skip. Her arms move in an exaggerated, back-and-forth rhythm, characteristic of stop-motion animation. Her movements are intentionally not perfectly fluid, highlighting the frame-by-frame nature of the claymation technique. The garden around her is a whimsical, textured world. In the foreground and mid-ground, oversized flowers with swirled purple and orange petals stand on thick green stems.

The model was also developed to test the ability of models to generalize to arbitrary image classification tasks in a zero-shot manner. It was not developed for general model deployment - to deploy models like CLIP, researchers will first need to carefully study their capabilities in relation to the specific context they’re being deployed within.\n\n### Model Date\n\nJanuary 2021\n\n### Model Type\n\nThe model uses a ViT-B/32 Transformer architecture as an image encoder and uses a masked self-attention Transformer as a text encoder. These encoders are trained to maximize the similarity of (image, text) pairs via a contrastive loss. \n\nThe original implementation had two variants: one using a ResNet image encoder and the other using a Vision Transformer. This repository has the variant with the Vision Transformer.\n\n\n### Documents\n\n- [Blog Post](https://openai.com/blog/clip/)\n- [CLIP Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020)\n\n\n### Use with Transformers\n\n```python3\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\nfrom transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel\n\nmodel = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")\nprocessor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")\n\nurl = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\ninputs = processor(text=["a photo of a cat", "a photo of a dog"], images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)\n\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image # this is the image-text similarity score\nprobs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1) # we can take the softmax to get the label probabilities\n```\n\n\n## Model Use\n\n### Intended Use\n\nThe model is intended as a research output for research communities. We hope that this model will enable researchers to better understand and explore zero-shot, arbitrary image classification. We also hope it can be used for interdisciplinary studies of the potential impact of such models - the CLIP paper includes a discussion of potential downstream impacts to provide an example for this sort of analysis.\n\n#### Primary intended uses\n\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI researchers.\n\nWe primarily imagine the model will be used by researchers to better understand robustness, generalization, and other capabilities, biases, and constraints of computer vision models.\n\n### Out-of-Scope Use Cases\n\n**Any** deployed use case of the model - whether commercial or not - is currently out of scope. Non-deployed use cases such as image search in a constrained environment, are also not recommended unless there is thorough in-domain testing of the model with a specific, fixed class taxonomy. This is because our safety assessment demonstrated a high need for task specific testing especially given the variability of CLIP’s performance with different class taxonomies. This makes untested and unconstrained deployment of the model in any use case currently potentially harmful. \n\nCertain use cases which would fall under the domain of surveillance and facial recognition are always out-of-scope regardless of performance of the model. This is because the use of artificial intelligence for tasks such as these can be premature currently given the lack of testing norms and checks to ensure its fair use.\n\nSince the model has not been purposefully trained in or evaluated on any languages other than English, its use should be limited to English language use cases.\n\n\n\n## Data\n\nThe model was trained on publicly available image-caption data. This was done through a combination of crawling a handful of websites and using commonly-used pre-existing image datasets such as [YFCC100M](http://projects.dfki.uni-kl.de/yfcc100m/). A large portion of the data comes from our crawling of the internet. This means that the data is more representative of people and societies most connected to the internet which tend to skew towards more developed nations, and younger, male users.\n\n### Data Mission Statement\n\nOur goal with building this dataset was to test out robustness and generalizability in computer vision tasks. As a result, the focus was on gathering large quantities of data from different publicly-available internet data sources. The data was gathered in a mostly non-interventionist manner. However, we only crawled websites that had policies against excessively violent and adult images and allowed us to filter out such content. We do not intend for this dataset to be used as the basis for any commercial or deployed model and will not be releasing the dataset.\n\n\n\n## Performance and Limitations\n\n### Performance\n\nWe have evaluated the performance of CLIP on a wide range of benchmarks across a variety of computer vision datasets such as OCR to texture recognition to fine-grained classification. The paper describes model performance on the following datasets:\n\n- Food101\n- CIFAR10   \n- CIFAR100   \n- Birdsnap\n- SUN397\n- Stanford Cars\n- FGVC Aircraft\n- VOC2007\n- DTD\n- Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset\n- Caltech101\n- Flowers102\n- MNIST   \n- SVHN \n- IIIT5K   \n- Hateful Memes   \n- SST-2\n- UCF101\n- Kinetics700\n- Country211\n- CLEVR Counting\n- KITTI Distance\n- STL-10\n- RareAct\n- Flickr30\n- MSCOCO\n- ImageNet\n- ImageNet-A\n- ImageNet-R\n- ImageNet Sketch\n- ObjectNet (ImageNet Overlap)\n- Youtube-BB\n- ImageNet-Vid\n\n## Limitations\n\nCLIP and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. CLIP currently struggles with respect to certain tasks such as fine grained classification and counting objects. CLIP also poses issues with regards to fairness and bias which we discuss in the paper and briefly in the next section. Additionally, our approach to testing CLIP also has an important limitation- in many cases we have used linear probes to evaluate the performance of CLIP and there is evidence suggesting that linear probes can underestimate model performance.\n\n### Bias and Fairness\n\nWe find that the performance of CLIP - and the specific biases it exhibits - can depend significantly on class design and the choices one makes for categories to include and exclude. We tested the risk of certain kinds of denigration with CLIP by classifying images of people from [Fairface](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04913) into crime-related and non-human animal categories. We found significant disparities with respect to race and gender. Additionally, we found that these disparities could shift based on how the classes were constructed. (Details captured in the Broader Impacts Section in the paper).\n\nWe also tested the performance of CLIP on gender, race and age classification using the Fairface dataset (We default to using race categories as they are constructed in the Fairface dataset.) in order to assess quality of performance across different demographics. We found accuracy >96% across all races for gender classification with ‘Middle Eastern’ having the highest accuracy (98.4%) and ‘White’ having the lowest (96.5%). Additionally, CLIP averaged ~93% for racial classification and ~63% for age classification. Our use of evaluations to test for gender, race and age classification as well as denigration harms is simply to evaluate performance of the model across people and surface potential risks and not to demonstrate an endorsement/enthusiasm for such tasks.\n\n\n\n## Feedback\n\n### Where to send questions or comments about the model\n\nPlease use [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/Uv7afRH5dvY34ZEs9)', '{"pipeline_tag":"zero-shot-image-classification","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":null,"storage_bytes":3632041404,"files_count":12,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["CLIPModel"],"model_type":"clip","tokenizer_config":{"unk_token":{"content":"<|endoftext|>","single_word":false,"lstrip":false,"rstrip":false,"normalized":true,"__type":"AddedToken"},"bos_token":{"content":"<|startoftext|>","single_word":false,"lstrip":false,"rstrip":false,"normalized":true,"__type":"AddedToken"},"eos_token":{"content":"<|endoftext|>","single_word":false,"lstrip":false,"rstrip":false,"normalized":true,"__type":"AddedToken"},"pad_token":"<|endoftext|>"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:CLIP","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/CLIP"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2103.00020","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:1908.04913","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04913"}]', NULL, NULL, 'pending', 54.1, 'cfa90db808c983eea7430f58dd92185e', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Introduction\n\nWe introduce DeepSeek-Prover-V2, an open-source large language model designed for formal theorem proving in Lean 4, with initialization data collected through a recursive theorem proving pipeline powered by DeepSeek-V3. The cold-start training procedure begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to decompose complex problems into a series of subgoals. The proofs of resolved subgoals are synthesized into a chain-of-thought process, combined with DeepSeek-V3''s step-by-step reasoning, to create an initial cold start for reinforcement learning. This process enables us to integrate both informal and formal mathematical reasoning into a unified model.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2/blob/main/figures/performance.png?raw=true">\n</p>\n\n## 2. Model Summary\n\n---\n\n**Synthesize Cold-Start Reasoning Data through Recursive Proof Search**\n\n- To construct the cold-start dataset, we develop a simple yet effective pipeline for recursive theorem proving, utilizing DeepSeek-V3 as a unified tool for both subgoal decomposition and formalization. We prompt DeepSeek-V3 to decompose theorems into high-level proof sketches while simultaneously formalizing these proof steps in Lean 4, resulting in a sequence of subgoals.\n\n- We use a smaller 7B model to handle the proof search for each subgoal, thereby reducing the associated computational burden. Once the decomposed steps of a challenging problem are resolved, we pair the complete step-by-step formal proof with the corresponding chain-of-thought from DeepSeek-V3 to create cold-start reasoning data.\n\n---\n\n**Reinforcement Learning with Synthetic Cold-Start Data**\n\n- We curate a subset of challenging problems that remain unsolved by the 7B prover model in an end-to-end manner, but for which all decomposed subgoals have been successfully resolved. By composing the proofs of all subgoals, we construct a complete formal proof for the original problem. This proof is then appended to DeepSeek-V3''s chain-of-thought, which outlines the corresponding lemma decomposition, thereby producing a cohesive synthesis of informal reasoning and subsequent formalization.\n\n- After fine-tuning the prover model on the synthetic cold-start data, we perform a reinforcement learning stage to further enhance its ability to bridge informal reasoning with formal proof construction. Following the standard training objective for reasoning models, we use binary correct-or-incorrect feedback as the primary form of reward supervision.\n- The resulting model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving, reaching $88.9$% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test and solving 49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench. The proofs generated by DeepSeek-Prover-V2 for the miniF2F dataset are available for download as a [ZIP archive](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2/blob/master/minif2f-solutions.zip).\n\n---\n\n## 3. ProverBench: Formalization of AIME and Textbook Problems\n\nwe introduce ProverBench, a benchmark dataset comprising 325 problems. Of these, 15 are formalized from number theory and algebra questions featured in the recent AIME competitions (AIME 24 and 25), offering authentic high-school competition-level challenges. The remaining 310 problems are drawn from curated textbook examples and educational tutorials, contributing a diverse and pedagogically grounded collection of formalized mathematical problems. This benchmark is designed to enable more comprehensive evaluation across both high-school competition problems and undergraduate-level mathematics.\n\n<div align="center">\n\n| Area                | Count |\n| :---------------------: | :-------: |\n| AIME 24&25          | 15    |\n| Number Theory       | 40    |\n| Elementary Algebra  | 30    |\n| Linear Algebra      | 50    |\n| Abstract Algebra    | 40    |\n| Calculus            | 90    |\n| Real Analysis       | 30    |\n| Complex Analysis    | 10    |\n| Functional Analysis | 10    |\n| Probability         | 10    |\n| Total               | 325   |\n\n</div>\n\n## 4.

Quick Start\n\nYou can directly use [Huggingface''s Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for model inference.

The license used is [MIT](https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n\n\n## Model Description\n\nMotivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder.\n\nLeveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder.\n\nExtensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification.\n\n- **Developed by:** Junyi Ao, Rui Wang, Long Zhou, Chengyi Wang, Shuo Ren, Yu Wu, Shujie Liu, Tom Ko, Qing Li, Yu Zhang, Zhihua Wei, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li, Furu Wei.\n- **Shared by [optional]:** [Matthijs Hollemans](https://huggingface.co/Matthijs)\n- **Model type:** text-to-speech\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** [More Information Needed]\n- **License:** [MIT](https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/blob/main/LICENSE)\n- **Finetuned from model [optional]:** [More Information Needed]\n\n\n## Model Sources [optional]\n\n<!-- Provide the basic links for the model. -->\n\n- **Repository:** [https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/]\n- **Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07205.pdf]\n- **Blog Post:** [https://huggingface.co/blog/speecht5]\n- **Demo:** [https://huggingface.co/spaces/Matthijs/speecht5-tts-demo]\n\n\n# Uses\n\n<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->\n\n## 🤗 Transformers Usage\n\nYou can run SpeechT5 TTS locally with the 🤗 Transformers library.\n\n1. First install the 🤗 [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), sentencepiece, soundfile and datasets(optional):\n\n```\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade transformers sentencepiece datasets[audio]\n```\n\n2. Run inference via the `Text-to-Speech` (TTS) pipeline. You can access the SpeechT5 model via the TTS pipeline in just a few lines of code!\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nimport soundfile as sf\n\nsynthesiser = pipeline("text-to-speech", "microsoft/speecht5_tts")\n\nembeddings_dataset = load_dataset("Matthijs/cmu-arctic-xvectors", split="validation")\nspeaker_embedding = torch.tensor(embeddings_dataset[7306]["xvector"]).unsqueeze(0)\n# You can replace this embedding with your own as well.\n\nspeech = synthesiser("Hello, my dog is cooler than you!", forward_params={"speaker_embeddings": speaker_embedding})\n\nsf.write("speech.wav", speech["audio"], samplerate=speech["sampling_rate"])\n```\n\n3. Run inference via the Transformers modelling code - You can use the processor + generate code to convert text into a mono 16 kHz speech waveform for more fine-grained control.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import SpeechT5Processor, SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech, SpeechT5HifiGan\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nimport torch\nimport soundfile as sf\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nprocessor = SpeechT5Processor.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")\nmodel = SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")\nvocoder = SpeechT5HifiGan.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_hifigan")\n\ninputs = processor(text="Hello, my dog is cute.", return_tensors="pt")\n\n# load xvector containing speaker''s voice characteristics from a dataset\nembeddings_dataset = load_dataset("Matthijs/cmu-arctic-xvectors", split="validation")\nspeaker_embeddings = torch.tensor(embeddings_dataset[7306]["xvector"]).unsqueeze(0)\n\nspeech = model.generate_speech(inputs["input_ids"], speaker_embeddings, vocoder=vocoder)\n\nsf.write("speech.wav", speech.numpy(), samplerate=16000)\n```\n\n### Fine-tuning the Model\n\nRefer to [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i7I5pzBcU3WDFarDnzweIj4-sVVoIUFJ) for an example of how to fine-tune SpeechT5 for TTS on a different dataset or a new language.\n\n\n## Direct Use\n\n<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->\n\nYou can use this model for speech synthesis.

Compared to the previous version, this upgrade brings improvements in multiple aspects:\n\n- **Hybrid thinking mode**: One model supports both thinking mode and non-thinking mode by changing the chat template. \n\n- **Smarter tool calling**: Through post-training optimization, the model''s performance in tool usage and agent tasks has significantly improved.\n\n- **Higher thinking efficiency**: DeepSeek-V3.1-Think achieves comparable answer quality to DeepSeek-R1-0528, while responding more quickly.\n\nDeepSeek-V3.1 is post-trained on the top of DeepSeek-V3.1-Base, which is built upon the original V3 base checkpoint through a two-phase long context extension approach, following the methodology outlined in the original DeepSeek-V3 report. We have expanded our dataset by collecting additional long documents and substantially extending both training phases. The 32K extension phase has been increased 10-fold to 630B tokens, while the 128K extension phase has been extended by 3.3x to 209B tokens.\n\nAdditionally, DeepSeek-V3.1 is trained using the **UE8M0 FP8 scale data format on both model weights and activations** to ensure compatibility with microscaling data formats. Please refer to [DeepGEMM](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM) for more details.\n\n## Model Downloads\n\n<div align="center">\n\n| **Model** | **#Total Params** | **#Activated Params** | **Context Length** | **Download** |\n| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |\n| DeepSeek-V3.1-Base | 671B | 37B | 128K | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1-Base) \| [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1-Base) |\n| DeepSeek-V3.1 | 671B | 37B | 128K | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1) \| [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1) |\n\n</div>\n\n## Chat Template\n\nThe details of our chat template is described in `tokenizer_config.json` and `assets/chat_template.jinja`. Here is a brief description.\n\n### Non-Thinking\n\n#### First-Turn\n\nPrefix:\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>`\n\nWith the given prefix, DeepSeek V3.1 generates responses to queries in non-thinking mode. Unlike DeepSeek V3,  it introduces an additional token `</think>`.\n\n#### Multi-Turn\nContext:\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>{response}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>...<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>{response}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>`\n\nPrefix:\n`<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>`\n\nBy concatenating the context and the prefix, we obtain the correct prompt for the query.\n\n### Thinking\n\n#### First-Turn\nPrefix:\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜><think>`\n\nThe prefix of thinking mode is similar to DeepSeek-R1. \n\n\n#### Multi-Turn\nContext:\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>{response}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>...<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>{response}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>`\n\nPrefix:\n`<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜><think>`\n\nThe multi-turn template is the same with non-thinking multi-turn chat template. It means the thinking token in the last turn will be dropped but the `</think>` is retained in every turn of context. \n\n### ToolCall\nToolcall is supported in non-thinking mode. The format is: \n\n`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>{system prompt}\n\n{tool_description}<｜User｜>{query}<｜Assistant｜></think>` where the tool_description is \n\n```\n## Tools\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n### {tool_name1}\nDescription: {description}\n\nParameters: {json.dumps(parameters)}\n\nIMPORTANT: ALWAYS adhere to this exact format for tool use:\n<｜tool▁calls▁begin｜><｜tool▁call▁begin｜>tool_call_name<｜tool▁sep｜>tool_call_arguments<｜tool▁call▁end｜>{additional_tool_calls}<｜tool▁calls▁end｜>\n\nWhere:\n- `tool_call_name` must be an exact match to one of the available tools\n- `tool_call_arguments` must be valid JSON that strictly follows the tool''s Parameters Schema\n- For multiple tool calls, chain them directly without separators or spaces\n```\n\n### Code-Agent\nWe support various code agent frameworks. Please refer to the above toolcall format to create your own code agents. An example is shown in `assets/code_agent_trajectory.html`.\n\n### Search-Agent\nWe design a specific format for searching toolcall in thinking mode, to support search agent. \n\nFor complex questions that require accessing external or up-to-date information, DeepSeek-V3.1 can leverage a user-provided search tool through a multi-turn tool-calling process.\n\nPlease refer to the `assets/search_tool_trajectory.html` and `assets/search_python_tool_trajectory.html` for the detailed template.\n\n## Evaluation\n| Category | Benchmark (Metric)              | DeepSeek V3.1-NonThinking | DeepSeek V3 0324 | DeepSeek V3.1-Thinking     | DeepSeek R1 0528\n|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------|---|---|---|\n| General  |\n|          | MMLU-Redux (EM)              | 91.8     | 90.5    | 93.7          | 93.4\n|          | MMLU-Pro (EM)                  | 83.7  | 81.2    | 84.8          | 85.0\n|          | GPQA-Diamond (Pass@1)           | 74.9   | 68.4   | 80.1            | 81.0\n|          | Humanity''s Last Exam (Pass@1)   | -    |       -            | 15.9         | 17.7\n|Search Agent| \n|          | BrowseComp       | -      | -  | 30.0 | 8.9\n|          | BrowseComp_zh       | -     | -  | 49.2      | 35.7\n|          | Humanity''s Last Exam (Python + Search)      |-   | -    | 29.8         | 24.8\n|          | SimpleQA             | -      | -    | 93.4  | 92.3\n| Code |\n|          | LiveCodeBench (2408-2505) (Pass@1)     | 56.4    | 43.0    | 74.8          | 73.3\n|          | Codeforces-Div1 (Rating)        | -   | -    | 2091            | 1930\n|          | Aider-Polyglot (Acc.)           | 68.4    | 55.1   | 76.3           | 71.6\n| Code Agent|\n|          | SWE Verified (Agent mode)           | 66.0       | 45.4  | -    | 44.6\n|          | SWE-bench Multilingual (Agent mode)         | 54.5    | 29.3   | -            | 30.5\n|          | Terminal-bench (Terminus 1 framework)       | 31.3     | 13.3      | -         | 5.7\n| Math |\n|          | AIME 2024 (Pass@1)                | 66.3     | 59.4     | 93.1      | 91.4\n|          | AIME 2025 (Pass@1)                     | 49.8  | 51.3 | 88.4          | 87.5\n|          | HMMT 2025 (Pass@1)        | 33.5    | 29.2   | 84.2 | 79.4 |\n\nNote: \n- Search agents are evaluated with our internal search framework, which uses a commercial search API + webpage filter + 128K context window. Seach agent results of R1-0528 are evaluated with a pre-defined workflow. \n\n- SWE-bench is evaluated with our internal code agent framework.\n\n- HLE is evaluated with the text-only subset.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```python\nimport transformers\n\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1")\n\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant"},\n    {"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"},\n    {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>Hmm</think>I am DeepSeek"},\n    {"role": "user", "content": "1+1=?"}\n]\n\ntokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, thinking=True, add_generation_prompt=True)\n# ''<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are a helpful assistant<｜User｜>Who are you?<｜Assistant｜></think>I am DeepSeek<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>1+1=?<｜Assistant｜><think>''\n\ntokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, thinking=False, add_generation_prompt=True)\n# ''<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are a helpful assistant<｜User｜>Who are you?<｜Assistant｜></think>I am DeepSeek<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>1+1=?<｜Assistant｜></think>''\n```\n\n## How to Run Locally\n\nThe model structure of DeepSeek-V3.1 is the same as DeepSeek-V3. Please visit [DeepSeek-V3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) repo for more information about running this model locally.\n\n**Usage Recommendations:**\n\n1. **The `mlp.gate.e_score_correction_bias `parameters should be loaded and computed in FP32 precision.**\n2. **Ensure that FP8 model weights and activations are formatted using the UE8M0 scale format.**\n\n##

VAD silence trimming with duration bounds (1-14s)\n3. Forced alignment (MFA) for clean phrase boundaries\n4. MinHash-LSH text deduplication\n5. Chromaprint audio deduplication\n6. SNAC encoding with 7-token frame packing\n\n### Voice Design Experiments: Why Natural Language Won\n\nWe tested 4 conditioning formats. Only one delivered production-quality results:\n\n**❌ Colon format:** `{description}: {text}` - Format drift, model spoke descriptions\n\n**❌ Angle-list attributes:** `<{age}, {pitch}, {character}>` - Too rigid, poor generalization\n\n**❌ Key-value tags:** `<age=40><pitch=low>` - Token bloat, brittle to mistakes\n\n**✅ XML-attribute (WINNER):** `<description="40-yr old, low-pitch, warm">` - Natural language, robust, scalable\n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### Game Character Voices\nGenerate unique character voices with emotions on-the-fly. No voice actor recording sessions.\n\n### Podcast & Audiobook Production\nNarrate content with emotional range and consistent personas across hours of audio.\n\n### AI Voice Assistants\nBuild conversational agents with natural emotional responses in real-time.\n\n### Video Content Creation\nCreate voiceovers for YouTube, TikTok, and social media with expressive delivery.\n\n### Customer Service AI\nDeploy empathetic voice bots that understand context and respond with appropriate emotions.\n\n### Accessibility Tools\nBuild screen readers and assistive technologies with natural, engaging voices.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q: What makes Maya1 different?**  \nA: We''re the only open source model offering 20+ emotions, zero-shot voice design, production-ready streaming, and 3B parameters—all in one package.\n\n**Q: Can I use this commercially?**  \nA: Absolutely. Apache 2.0 license. Build products, deploy services, monetize freely.\n\n**Q: What languages does it support?**  \nA: Currently English with multi-accent support. Future models will expand to languages and accents underserved by mainstream voice AI.\n\n**Q: How does it compare to ElevenLabs, Murf.ai, or other closed-source tools?**  \nA: Feature parity with emotions and voice design. Advantage: you own the deployment, pay no per-second fees, and can customize the model.\n\n**Q: Can I fine-tune on my own voices?**  \nA: Yes. The model architecture supports fine-tuning on custom datasets for specialized voices.\n\n**Q: What GPU do I need?**  \nA: Single GPU with 16GB+ VRAM (A100, H100, or consumer RTX 4090).\n\n**Q: Is streaming really real-time?**  \nA: Yes. SNAC codec enables sub-100ms latency with vLLM deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Comparison\n\n| Feature | Maya1 | ElevenLabs | OpenAI TTS | Coqui TTS |\n|---------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|\n| **Open Source** | Yes | No | No | Yes |\n| **Emotions** | 20+ | Limited | No | No |\n| **Voice Design** | Natural Language | Voice Library | Fixed | Complex |\n| **Streaming** | Real-time | Yes | Yes | No |\n| **Cost** | Free | Pay-per-use | Pay-per-use | Free |\n| **Customization** | Full | Limited | None | Moderate |\n| **Parameters** | 3B | Unknown | Unknown | <1B |\n\n---\n\n## Model Metadata\n\n**Developed by:** Maya Research  \n**Website:** [mayaresearch.ai](https://mayaresearch.ai)  \n**Backed by:** South Park Commons  \n**Model Type:** Text-to-Speech, Emotional Voice Synthesis, Voice Design AI  \n**Language:** English (Multi-accent)  \n**Architecture:** 3B-parameter Llama-style transformer with SNAC codec  \n**License:** Apache 2.0 (Fully Open Source)  \n**Training Data:** Proprietary curated + Internet-scale pretraining  \n**Audio Quality:** 24 kHz, mono, ~0.98 kbps streaming  \n**Inference:** vLLM compatible, single GPU deployment  \n**Status:** Production-ready (Novermber 2025)  \n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Hugging Face Model Hub\n```bash\n# Clone the model repository\ngit lfs install\ngit clone https://huggingface.co/maya-research/maya1\n\n# Or load directly in Python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("maya-research/maya1")\n```\n\n### Requirements\n```bash\npip install torch transformers snac soundfile\n```\n\n### Additional Resources\n- **Full emotion list:** [emotions.txt](https://huggingface.co/maya-research/maya1/blob/main/emotions.txt)\n- **Prompt examples:** [prompt.txt](https://huggingface.co/maya-research/maya1/blob/main/prompt.txt)\n- **Streaming script:** [vllm_streaming_inference.py](https://huggingface.co/maya-research/maya1/blob/main/vllm_streaming_inference.py)\n\n---\n\n## Citations & References\n\nIf you use Maya1 in your research or product, please cite:\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{maya1voice2025,\n  title={Maya1: Open Source Voice AI with Emotional Intelligence},\n  author={Maya Research},\n  year={2025},\n  publisher={Hugging Face},\n  howpublished={\url{https://huggingface.co/maya-research/maya1}},\n}\n```\n\n**Key Technologies:**\n- SNAC Neural Audio Codec: https://github.com/hubertsiuzdak/snac\n- Mimi Adversarial Codec: https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi\n- vLLM Inference Engine: https://docs.vllm.ai/\n\n---\n\n## Why We Build Open Source Voice AI\n\nVoice AI will be everywhere, but it''s fundamentally broken for 90% of the world. Current voice models only work well for a narrow slice of English speakers because training data for most accents, languages, and speaking styles simply doesn''t exist.\n\n**Maya Research** builds emotionally intelligent, native voice models that finally let the rest of the world speak. We''re open source because we believe voice intelligence should not be a privilege reserved for the few.\n\n**Technology should be open** - The best voice AI tools should not be locked behind proprietary APIs charging per-second fees.\n\n**Community drives innovation** - Open source accelerates research. When developers worldwide can build on our work, everyone wins.\n\n**Voice intelligence for everyone** - We''re building for the 90% of the world ignored by mainstream voice AI. That requires open models, not closed platforms.\n\n---\n\n**Maya Research** - Building voice intelligence for the 90% of the world left behind by mainstream AI.\n\n**Website:** [mayaresearch.ai](https://mayaresearch.ai)  \n**Twitter/X:** [@mayaresearch_ai](https://x.com/mayaresearch_ai)  \n**Hugging Face:** [maya-research](https://huggingface.co/maya-research)  \n**Backed by:** South Park Commons\n\n**License:** Apache 2.0  \n**Mission:** Emotionally intelligent voice models that finally let everyone speak', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-to-speech","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":3300928512,"storage_bytes":99052652539,"files_count":19,"spaces_count":14,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["LlamaForCausalLM"],"model_type":"llama","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"<|begin_of_text|>","eos_token":"<|eot_id|>","pad_token":"<custom_token_7>"},"chat_template_jinja":"{{- bos_token }}\n{%- if custom_tools is defined %}\n    {%- set tools = custom_tools %}\n{%- endif %}\n{%- if not tools_in_user_message is defined %}\n    {%- set tools_in_user_message = true %}\n{%- endif %}\n{%- if not date_string is defined %}\n    {%- if strftime_now is defined %}\n        {%- set date_string = strftime_now(\"%d %b %Y\") %}\n    {%- else %}\n        {%- set date_string = \"26 Jul 2024\" %}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endif %}\n{%- if not tools is defined %}\n    {%- set tools = none %}\n{%- endif %}\n\n{#- This block extracts the system message, so we can slot it into the right place. #}\n{%- if messages[0][''role''] == ''system'' %}\n    {%- set system_message = messages[0][''content'']|trim %}\n    {%- set messages = messages[1:] %}\n{%- else %}\n    {%- set system_message = \"\" %}\n{%- endif %}\n\n{#- System message #}\n{{- \"<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\" }}\n{%- if tools is not none %}\n    {{- \"Environment: ipython\\n\" }}\n{%- endif %}\n{{- \"Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\\n\" }}\n{{- \"Today Date: \" + date_string + \"\\n\\n\" }}\n{%- if tools is not none and not tools_in_user_message %}\n    {{- \"You have access to the following functions.

variant.\n\nHere are the [metrics](https://tinyurl.com/nllb200densedst600mmetrics) for that particular checkpoint.\n\n- Information about training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints or other applied approaches, and features. The exact training algorithm, data and the strategies to handle data imbalances for high and low resource languages that were used to train NLLB-200 is described in the paper.\n- Paper or other resource for more information NLLB Team et al, No Language Left Behind: Scaling Human-Centered Machine Translation, Arxiv, 2022\n- License: CC-BY-NC\n- Where to send questions or comments about the model: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/issues\n\n\n\n## Intended Use\n- Primary intended uses: NLLB-200 is a machine translation model primarily intended for research in machine translation, - especially for low-resource languages. It allows for single sentence translation among 200 languages. Information on how to - use the model can be found in Fairseq code repository along with the training code and references to evaluation and training data.\n- Primary intended users: Primary users are researchers and machine translation research community.\n- Out-of-scope use cases: NLLB-200 is a research model and is not released for production deployment. NLLB-200 is trained on general domain text data and is not intended to be used with domain specific texts, such as medical domain or legal domain. The model is not intended to be used for document translation. The model was trained with input lengths not exceeding 512 tokens, therefore translating longer sequences might result in quality degradation. NLLB-200 translations can not be used as certified translations. \n\n## Metrics\n• Model performance measures: NLLB-200 model was evaluated using BLEU, spBLEU, and chrF++ metrics widely adopted by machine translation community. Additionally, we performed human evaluation with the XSTS protocol and measured the toxicity of the generated translations.\n\n\n## Evaluation Data\n- Datasets: Flores-200 dataset is described in Section 4\n- Motivation: We used Flores-200 as it provides full evaluation coverage of the languages in NLLB-200\n- Preprocessing: Sentence-split raw text data was preprocessed using SentencePiece. The\nSentencePiece model is released along with NLLB-200.\n\n## Training Data\n• We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n• In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety).\n\n## Caveats and Recommendations\n• Our model has been tested on the Wikimedia domain with limited investigation on other domains supported in NLLB-MD. In addition, the supported languages may have variations that our model is not capturing. Users should make appropriate assessments.\n\n## Carbon Footprint Details\n• The carbon dioxide (CO2e) estimate is reported in Section 8.8.', '{"pipeline_tag":"translation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":null,"storage_bytes":15838819981,"files_count":9,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["M2M100ForConditionalGeneration"],"model_type":"m2m_100","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"<s>","cls_token":"<s>","eos_token":"</s>","mask_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"<mask>","lstrip":true,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false},"pad_token":"<pad>","sep_token":"</s>","unk_token":"<unk>"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:facebookresearch:fairseq","source_url":"https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq"}]', NULL, 'CC-BY-NC-4.0', 'approved', 64.1, '8116fc101af9f8e14047846232c5d362', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

It was\nintroduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108). The code for the distillation process can be found\n[here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/distillation). This model is uncased: it does\nnot make a difference between english and English.\n\n## Model description\n\nDistilBERT is a transformers model, smaller and faster than BERT, which was pretrained on the same corpus in a\nself-supervised fashion, using the BERT base model as a teacher. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only,\nwith no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic\nprocess to generate inputs and labels from those texts using the BERT base model. More precisely, it was pretrained\nwith three objectives:\n\n- Distillation loss: the model was trained to return the same probabilities as the BERT base model.\n- Masked language modeling (MLM): this is part of the original training loss of the BERT base model. When taking a\n  sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the\n  model and has to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that\n  usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future\n  tokens. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\n- Cosine embedding loss: the model was also trained to generate hidden states as close as possible as the BERT base\n  model.\n\nThis way, the model learns the same inner representation of the English language than its teacher model, while being\nfaster for inference or downstream tasks.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it''s mostly intended to\nbe fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=distilbert) to look for\nfine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)\nto make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text\ngeneration you should look at model like GPT2.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline(''fill-mask'', model=''distilbert-base-uncased'')\n>>> unmasker("Hello I''m a [MASK] model.")\n\n[{''sequence'': "[CLS] hello i''m a role model. [SEP]",\n  ''score'': 0.05292855575680733,\n  ''token'': 2535,\n  ''token_str'': ''role''},\n {''sequence'': "[CLS] hello i''m a fashion model.

[SEP]",\n  ''score'': 0.018145186826586723,\n  ''token'': 11643,\n  ''token_str'': ''modeling''}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, DistilBertModel\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(''distilbert-base-uncased'')\nmodel = DistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")\ntext = "Replace me by any text you''d like."\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=''pt'')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, TFDistilBertModel\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(''distilbert-base-uncased'')\nmodel = TFDistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")\ntext = "Replace me by any text you''d like."\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=''tf'')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nEven if the training data used for this model could be characterized as fairly neutral, this model can have biased\npredictions. It also inherits some of\n[the bias of its teacher model](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased#limitations-and-bias).\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline(''fill-mask'', model=''distilbert-base-uncased'')\n>>> unmasker("The White man worked as a [MASK].")\n\n[{''sequence'': ''[CLS] the white man worked as a blacksmith.

The inputs of the model are\nthen of the form:\n\n```\n[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]\n```\n\nWith probability 0.5, sentence A and sentence B correspond to two consecutive sentences in the original corpus and in\nthe other cases, it''s another random sentence in the corpus. Note that what is considered a sentence here is a\nconsecutive span of text usually longer than a single sentence. The only constrain is that the result with the two\n"sentences" has a combined length of less than 512 tokens.\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n- 15% of the tokens are masked.\n- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `[MASK]`.\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on 8 16 GB V100 for 90 hours. See the\n[training code](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/distillation) for all hyperparameters\ndetails.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWhen fine-tuned on downstream tasks, this model achieves the following results:\n\nGlue test results:\n\n| Task | MNLI | QQP  | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | STS-B | MRPC | RTE  |\n|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|\n|      | 82.2 | 88.5 | 89.2 | 91.3  | 51.3 | 85.8  | 87.5 | 59.9 |\n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{Sanh2019DistilBERTAD,\n  title={DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter},\n  author={Victor Sanh and Lysandre Debut and Julien Chaumond and Thomas Wolf},\n  journal={ArXiv},\n  year={2019},\n  volume={abs/1910.01108}\n}\n```\n\n<a href="https://huggingface.co/exbert/?model=distilbert-base-uncased">\n	<img width="300px" src="https://cdn-media.huggingface.co/exbert/button.png">\n</a>\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"fill-mask","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":66985530,"storage_bytes":2287292255,"files_count":12,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["DistilBertForMaskedLM"],"model_type":"distilbert","tokenizer_config":{}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:1910.01108","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 64, '07a505ac34ce52eecb3c457d6c37219c', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Meanwhile, specifying `enable_thinking=False` is no longer required.**\n\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n\n## Quickstart\n\nWe advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.51.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen3_moe''\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto"\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = "Write a quick sort algorithm."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=65536\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\nprint("content:", content)\n```\n\n**Note: If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues, consider reducing the context length to a shorter value, such as `32,768`.**\n\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\n\n## Agentic Coding\n\nQwen3-Coder excels in tool calling capabilities. \n\nYou can simply define or use any tools as following example.\n```python\n# Your tool implementation\ndef square_the_number(num: float) -> dict:\n    return num ** 2\n\n# Define Tools\ntools=[\n    {\n        "type":"function",\n        "function":{\n            "name": "square_the_number",\n            "description": "output the square of the number.",\n            "parameters": {\n                "type": "object",\n                "required": ["input_num"],\n                "properties": {\n                    ''input_num'': {\n                        ''type'': ''number'', \n                        ''description'': ''input_num is a number that will be squared''\n                        }\n                },\n            }\n        }\n    }\n]\n\nimport OpenAI\n# Define LLM\nclient = OpenAI(\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API\n    base_url=''http://localhost:8000/v1'',  # api_base\n    api_key="EMPTY"\n)\n \nmessages = [{''role'': ''user'', ''content'': ''square the number 1024''}]\n\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\n    messages=messages,\n    model="Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct",\n    max_tokens=65536,\n    tools=tools,\n)\n\nprint(completion.choice[0])\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - We suggest using `temperature=0.7`, `top_p=0.8`, `top_k=20`, `repetition_penalty=1.05`.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 65,536 tokens for most queries, which is adequate for instruct models.\n\n\n### Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\n      title={Qwen3 Technical Report}, \n

Our approach is built upon three key technical breakthroughs:\n\n1. **DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA):** We introduce DSA, an efficient attention mechanism that substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance, specifically optimized for long-context scenarios.\n2. **Scalable Reinforcement Learning Framework:** By implementing a robust RL protocol and scaling post-training compute, *DeepSeek-V3.2* performs comparably to GPT-5. Notably, our high-compute variant, **DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale**, **surpasses GPT-5** and exhibits reasoning proficiency on par with Gemini-3.0-Pro.\n    - *Achievement:* 🥇 **Gold-medal performance** in the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).\n3. **Large-Scale Agentic Task Synthesis Pipeline:** To integrate **reasoning into tool-use** scenarios, we developed a novel synthesis pipeline that systematically generates training data at scale. This facilitates scalable agentic post-training, improving compliance and generalization in complex interactive environments.\n\n<div align="center">\n <img src="assets/benchmark.png" >\n</div>\n\nWe have also released the final submissions for IOI 2025, ICPC World Finals, IMO 2025 and CMO 2025, which were selected based on our designed pipeline. These materials are provided for the community to conduct secondary verification. The files can be accessed at `assets/olympiad_cases`.\n\n## Chat Template\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 introduces significant updates to its chat template compared to prior versions. The primary changes involve a revised format for tool calling and the introduction of a "thinking with tools" capability.\n\nTo assist the community in understanding and adapting to this new template, we have provided a dedicated `encoding` folder, which contains Python scripts and test cases demonstrating how to encode messages in OpenAI-compatible format into input strings for the model and how to parse the model''s text output.\n\nA brief example is illustrated below:\n\n```python\nimport transformers\n# encoding/encoding_dsv32.py\nfrom encoding_dsv32 import encode_messages, parse_message_from_completion_text\n\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2")\n\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": "hello"},\n    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I am DeepSeek.", "reasoning_content": "thinking..."},\n    {"role": "user", "content": "1+1=?"}\n]\nencode_config = dict(thinking_mode="thinking", drop_thinking=True, add_default_bos_token=True)\n\n# messages -> string\nprompt = encode_messages(messages, **encode_config)\n# Output: "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>hello<｜Assistant｜></think>Hello! I am DeepSeek.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>1+1=?<｜Assistant｜><think>"\n\n# string -> tokens\ntokens = tokenizer.encode(prompt)\n# Output: [0, 128803, 33310, 128804, 128799, 19923, 3, 342, 1030, 22651, 4374, 1465, 16, 1, 128803, 19, 13, 19, 127252, 128804, 128798]\n```\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n1. This release does not include a Jinja-format chat template. Please refer to the Python code mentioned above.\n2. The output parsing function included in the code is designed to handle well-formatted strings only. It does not attempt to correct or recover from malformed output that the model might occasionally generate. It is not suitable for production use without robust error handling.\n3. A new role named `developer` has been introduced in the chat template. This role is dedicated exclusively to search agent scenarios and is designated for no other tasks. The official API does not accept messages assigned to `developer`.\n\n## How to Run Locally\n\nThe model structure of DeepSeek-V3.2 and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale are the same as DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. Please visit [DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp) repo for more information about running this model locally.\n\nUsage Recommendations:\n\n1. For local deployment, we recommend setting the sampling parameters to `temperature = 1.0, top_p = 0.95`.\n2. Please note that the DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale variant is designed exclusively for deep reasoning tasks and does not support the tool-calling functionality.\n\n## License\n\nThis repository and the model weights are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Citation\n\n```\n@misc{deepseekai2025deepseekv32,\n      title={DeepSeek-V3.2: Pushing the Frontier of Open Large Language Models}, \n      author={DeepSeek-AI},\n      year={2025},\n}\n```\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you have any questions, please raise an issue or contact us at [service@deepseek.com](service@deepseek.com).\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":685396921376,"storage_bytes":689484423011,"files_count":192,"spaces_count":19,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["DeepseekV32ForCausalLM"],"model_type":"deepseek_v32","quantization_config":{"quant_method":"fp8"},"tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>","lstrip":false,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false},"eos_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>","lstrip":false,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false},"pad_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>","lstrip":false,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false},"unk_token":null}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:deepseek-ai:DeepSeek-V2","source_url":"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:deepseek-ai:DeepSeek-V2","source_url":"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:deepseek-ai:DeepSeek-V2","source_url":"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:deepseek-ai:DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp","source_url":"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 84, '2d91c9c620c9755ecf0a7f560674c78f', NULL, 'https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2/resolve/main/assets/benchmark.png', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Built off a 0.5B LLM backbone, NeuTTS Air brings natural-sounding speech, real-time performance, built-in security and speaker cloning to your local device - unlocking a new category of embedded voice agents, assistants, toys, and compliance-safe apps.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- 🗣Best-in-class realism for its size - produces natural, ultra-realistic voices that sound human\n- 📱Optimised for on-device deployment - provided in GGML format, ready to run on phones, laptops, or even Raspberry Pis\n- 👫Instant voice cloning - create your own speaker with as little as 3 seconds of audio\n- 🚄Simple LM + codec architecture built off a 0.5B backbone - the sweet spot between speed, size, and quality for real-world applications\n\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Websites like neutts.com are popping up and they''re not affliated with Neuphonic, our github or this repo.\n>\n> We are on neuphonic.com only. Please be careful out there! 🙏\n\n\n## Model Details\n\nNeuTTS Air is built off Qwen 0.5B - a lightweight yet capable language model optimised for text understanding and generation - as well as a powerful combination of technologies designed for efficiency and quality:\n\n- **Audio Codec**: [NeuCodec](https://huggingface.co/neuphonic/neucodec) - our proprietary neural audio codec that achieves exceptional audio quality at low bitrates using a single codebook\n- **Format**: Available in GGML format for efficient on-device inference\n- **Responsibility**: Watermarked outputs\n- **Inference Speed**: Real-time generation on mid-range devices\n- **Power Consumption**: Optimised for mobile and embedded devices\n\n## Get Started\n\n1. **Clone the [Git Repo](https://github.com/neuphonic/neutts-air)**\n    \n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/neuphonic/neutts-air.git\n    cd neuttsair\n    ```\n    \n2. **Install `espeak` (required dependency)**\n    \n    Please refer to the following link for instructions on how to install `espeak`:\n    \n    https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/guide.md\n    \n    ```bash\n    # Mac OS\n    brew install espeak\n    \n    # Ubuntu/Debian\n    sudo apt install espeak\n\n    # Arch Linux\n    paru -S aur/espeak\n    ```\n    \n3. **Install Python dependencies**\n    \n    The requirements file includes the dependencies needed to run the model with PyTorch. When using an ONNX decoder or a GGML model, some dependencies (such as PyTorch) are no longer required.\n    \n    The inference is compatible and tested on `python>=3.11`.\n    \n    ```\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    \n    ```\n    \n\n## **Basic Example**\n\nRun the basic example script to synthesize speech:\n\n```bash\npython -m examples.basic_example \\n  --input_text "My name is Dave, and um, I''m from London" \\n  --ref_audio samples/dave.wav \\n  --ref_text samples/dave.txt\n\n```\n\nTo specify a particular model repo for the backbone or codec, add the `--backbone` argument. Available backbones are listed in [NeuTTS-Air huggingface collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/neuphonic/neutts-air-68cc14b7033b4c56197ef350).\n\nSeveral examples are available, including a Jupyter notebook in the `examples` folder.\n\n### **Simple One-Code Block Usage**\n\n```python\nfrom neuttsair.neutts import NeuTTSAir\nimport soundfile as sf\n\ntts = NeuTTSAir( backbone_repo="neuphonic/neutts-air-q4-gguf", backbone_device="cpu", codec_repo="neuphonic/neucodec", codec_device="cpu")\ninput_text = "My name is Dave, and um, I''m from London."\n\nref_text = "samples/dave.txt"\nref_audio_path = "samples/dave.wav"\n\nref_text = open(ref_text, "r").read().strip()\nref_codes = tts.encode_reference(ref_audio_path)\n\nwav = tts.infer(input_text, ref_codes, ref_text)\nsf.write("test.wav", wav, 24000)\n\n```\n\n# Tips\n\nNeuTTS Air requires two inputs:\n\n1. A reference audio sample (`.wav` file)\n2. A text string\n\nThe model then synthesises the text as speech in the style of the reference audio. This is what enables NeuTTS Air’s instant voice cloning capability.\n\n### Example Reference Files\n\nYou can find some ready-to-use samples in the `examples` folder:\n\n- `samples/dave.wav`\n- `samples/jo.wav`\n\n### Guidelines for Best Results\n\nFor optimal performance, reference audio samples should be:\n\n1. **Mono channel**\n2. **16-44 kHz sample rate**\n3. **3–15 seconds in length**\n4. **Saved as a `.wav` file**\n5. **Clean** — minimal to no background noise\n6. **Natural, continuous speech** — like a monologue or conversation, with few pauses, so the model can capture tone effectively\n\n# **Responsibility**\n\nEvery audio file generated by NeuTTS Air includes [**Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth).**\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nDon''t use this model to do bad things… please.', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-to-speech","library_name":null,"framework":null,"params":null,"storage_bytes":10621210568,"files_count":11,"spaces_count":6,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Qwen2ForCausalLM"],"model_type":"qwen2"}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:neuphonic:neutts-air","source_url":"https://github.com/neuphonic/neutts-air"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:neuphonic:neutts-air","source_url":"https://github.com/neuphonic/neutts-air"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:neuphonic:neutts-air.git","source_url":"https://github.com/neuphonic/neutts-air.git"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:espeak-ng:espeak-ng","source_url":"https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:resemble-ai:perth","source_url":"https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 64, '7e5341b3484182e6c9cadf4535088ded', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Default is True.\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n    # rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\n    index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\n    index = 0\n\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip("\n")\n\nprint("thinking content:", thinking_content)\nprint("content:", content)\n```\n\nFor deployment, you can use `sglang>=0.4.6.post1` or `vllm>=0.8.5` or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\n- SGLang:\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-8B --reasoning-parser qwen3\n    ```\n- vLLM:\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\n    ```\n\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\n\n## Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The `enable_thinking` switch is also available in APIs created by SGLang and vLLM. \n> Please refer to our documentation for [SGLang](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/sglang.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) and [vLLM](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) users.\n\n### `enable_thinking=True`\n\nBy default, Qwen3 has thinking capabilities enabled, similar to QwQ-32B. This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting `enable_thinking=True` or leaving it as the default value in `tokenizer.apply_chat_template`, the model will engage its thinking mode.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a `<think>...</think>` block, followed by the final response.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For thinking mode, use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0` (the default setting in `generation_config.json`). **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n\n### `enable_thinking=False`\n\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model''s thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For non-thinking mode, we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n### Advanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input\n\nWe provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model''s behavior when `enable_thinking=True`. Specifically, you can add `/think` and `/no_think` to user prompts or system messages to switch the model''s thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\n\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nclass QwenChatbot:\n    def __init__(self, model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-8B"):\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.history = []\n\n    def generate_response(self, user_input):\n        messages = self.history + [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]\n\n        text = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tokenize=False,\n            add_generation_prompt=True\n        )\n\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")\n        response_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n        response = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n        # Update history\n        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})\n        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})\n\n        return response\n\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    chatbot = QwenChatbot()\n\n    # First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\n    user_input_1 = "How many r''s in strawberries?"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_1}")\n    response_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_1}")\n    print("----------------------")\n\n    # Second input with /no_think\n    user_input_2 = "Then, how many r''s in blueberries? /no_think"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_2}")\n    response_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_2}") \n    print("----------------------")\n\n    # Third input with /think\n    user_input_3 = "Really? /think"\n    print(f"User: {user_input_3}")\n    response_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\n    print(f"Bot: {response_3}")\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For API compatibility, when `enable_thinking=True`, regardless of whether the user uses `/think` or `/no_think`, the model will always output a block wrapped in `<think>...</think>`. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled.\n> When `enable_thinking=False`, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any `/think` or `/no_think` tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n## Agentic Use\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n```python\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n    ''model'': ''Qwen3-8B'',\n\n    # Use the endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio:\n    # ''model_type'': ''qwen_dashscope'',\n    # ''api_key'': os.getenv(''DASHSCOPE_API_KEY''),\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    ''model_server'': ''http://localhost:8000/v1'',  # api_base\n    ''api_key'': ''EMPTY'',\n\n    # Other parameters:\n    # ''generate_cfg'': {\n    #         # Add: When the response content is `<think>this is the thought</think>this is the answer;\n    #         # Do not add: When the response has been separated by reasoning_content and content.\n    #         ''thought_in_content'': True,\n    #     },\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {''mcpServers'': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            ''time'': {\n                ''command'': ''uvx'',\n                ''args'': [''mcp-server-time'', ''--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai'']\n            },\n            "fetch": {\n                "command": "uvx",\n                "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  ''code_interpreter'',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{''role'': ''user'', ''content'': ''https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen''}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n## Processing Long Texts\n\nQwen3 natively supports context lengths of up to 32,768 tokens. For conversations where the total length (including both input and output) significantly exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively. We have validated the model''s performance on context lengths of up to 131,072 tokens using the [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071) method.\n\nYaRN is currently supported by several inference frameworks, e.g., `transformers` and `llama.cpp` for local use, `vllm` and `sglang` for deployment. In general, there are two approaches to enabling YaRN for supported frameworks:\n\n- Modifying the model files:\n  In the `config.json` file, add the `rope_scaling` fields:\n    ```json\n    {\n        ...,\n        "rope_scaling": {\n            "rope_type": "yarn",\n            "factor": 4.0,\n            "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n  For `llama.cpp`, you need to regenerate the GGUF file after the modification.\n\n- Passing command line arguments:\n\n  For `vllm`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve ... --rope-scaling ''{"rope_type":"yarn","factor":4.0,"original_max_position_embeddings":32768}'' --max-model-len 131072  \n    ```\n\n  For `sglang`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server ... --json-model-override-args ''{"rope_scaling":{"rope_type":"yarn","factor":4.0,"original_max_position_embeddings":32768}}''\n    ```\n\n  For `llama-server` from `llama.cpp`, you can use\n    ```shell\n    llama-server ... --rope-scaling yarn --rope-scale 4 --yarn-orig-ctx 32768\n    ```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you encounter the following warning\n> ```\n> Unrecognized keys in `rope_scaling` for ''rope_type''=''yarn'': {''original_max_position_embeddings''}\n> ```\n> please upgrade `transformers>=4.51.0`.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> All the notable open-source frameworks implement static YaRN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.**\n> We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required. \n> It is also recommended to modify the `factor` as needed. For example, if the typical context length for your application is 65,536 tokens, it would be better to set `factor` as 2.0. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The default `max_position_embeddings` in `config.json` is set to 40,960. This allocation includes reserving 32,768 tokens for outputs and 8,192 tokens for typical prompts, which is sufficient for most scenarios involving short text processing. If the average context length does not exceed 32,768 tokens, we do not recommend enabling YaRN in this scenario, as it may potentially degrade model performance.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio supports dynamic YaRN by default and no extra configuration is needed.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - For thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`), use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\n   - For non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`), we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\n\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n   - **Math Problems**: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `"answer": "C"`."\n\n4. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2.

This is then diffused up to the waveform level, with post-processing applied to clean up the audio.\n\n* We use a causal GPT to predict the first two hierarchies of EnCodec tokens. Text and audio are part of the LLM context. Speaker information is passed via conditioning at the token embedding layer. This speaker conditioning is obtained from a separately trained speaker verification network.\n  - The two hierarchies are predicted in a "flattened interleaved" manner, we predict the first token of the first hierarchy, then the first token of the second hierarchy, then the second token of the first hierarchy, and so on.\n  - We use condition-free sampling to boost the cloning capability of the model.\n  - The text is tokenised using a custom trained BPE tokeniser with 512 tokens.\n  - Note that we''ve skipped predicting semantic tokens as done in other works, as we found that this isn''t strictly necessary.\n* We use a non-causal (encoder-style) transformer to predict the rest of the 6 hierarchies from the first two hierarchies. This is a super small model (~10Mn parameters), and has extensive zero-shot generalisation to most speakers we''ve tried. Since it''s non-causal, we''re also able to predict all the timesteps in parallel.\n* We use multi-band diffusion to generate waveforms from the EnCodec tokens. We noticed that the speech is clearer than using the original RVQ decoder or VOCOS. However, the diffusion at waveform level leaves some background artifacts which are quite unpleasant to the ear. We clean this up in the next step.\n* We use DeepFilterNet to clear up the artifacts introduced by the multi-band diffusion. \n\n## Optimizations\nThe model supports: \n1. KV-caching via Flash Decoding \n2. Batching (including texts of different lengths)\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-to-speech","library_name":"metavoice","framework":"metavoice","params":null,"storage_bytes":5047828383,"files_count":6,"spaces_count":11,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:metavoiceio:metavoice-src","source_url":"https://github.com/metavoiceio/metavoice-src"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:metavoiceio:metavoice-src","source_url":"https://github.com/metavoiceio/metavoice-src?tab=readme-ov-file#finetuning"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 64, 'bad0ac2f3b44080e8d2f747164a6a22d', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Pass "enable_thinking=False" when calling apply_chat_template.\n2. Adding "/no_think" before the prompt will force the model not to use perform CoT reasoning. Similarly, adding "/think" before the prompt will force the model to perform CoT reasoning.\n\nThe following code snippet shows how to use the transformers library to load and apply the model. \nIt also demonstrates how to enable and disable the reasoning mode , \nand how to parse the reasoning process along with the final output.\n\n\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nimport os\nimport re\n\nmodel_name_or_path = os.environ[''MODEL_PATH'']\n# model_name_or_path = "tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, trust_remote_code=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, device_map="auto",trust_remote_code=True)  # You may want to use bfloat16 and/or move to GPU here\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short summary of the benefits of regular exercise"},\n]\n\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tokenize=False,\n            enable_thinking=True\n            )\n\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\nmodel_inputs.pop("token_type_ids", None)\noutputs = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=4096)\n\n\noutput_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])\n\nthink_pattern = r''<think>(.*?)</think>''\nthink_matches = re.findall(think_pattern, output_text, re.DOTALL)\n\nanswer_pattern = r''<answer>(.*?)</answer>''\nanswer_matches = re.findall(answer_pattern, output_text, re.DOTALL)\n\nthink_content = [match.strip() for match in think_matches][0]\nanswer_content = [match.strip() for match in answer_matches][0]\nprint(f"thinking_content:{think_content}\n\n")\nprint(f"answer_content:{answer_content}\n\n")\n```\n\n### Fast and slow thinking switch\n\nThis model supports two modes of operation:\n\n- Slow Thinking Mode (Default): Enables detailed internal reasoning steps before producing the final answer.\n- Fast Thinking Mode: Skips the internal reasoning process for faster inference, going straight to the final answer.\n\n**Switching to Fast Thinking Mode:**\n\nTo disable the reasoning process, set `enable_thinking=False` in the apply_chat_template call:\n```\n\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tokenize=False,\n            enable_thinking=False\n            )\n```                                           \n\n\n\n## Deployment   \n\nFor deployment, you can use frameworks such as **TensorRT-LLM**, **vLLM**, or **SGLang** to serve the model and create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.\n\nimage: https://hub.docker.com/r/hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-a13b/tags \n\n\n### TensorRT-LLM\n\n#### Docker Image \n\nWe provide a pre-built Docker image based on the latest version of TensorRT-LLM.\n\n- To Get Started, Download the Docker Image:\n\n**From Docker Hub:**\n```\ndocker pull hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-a13b:hunyuan-moe-A13B-trtllm\n```\n\n**From China Mirror(Thanks to [CNB](https://cnb.cool/ "CNB.cool")):**\n\n\nFirst, pull the image from CNB:\n``` \ndocker pull docker.cnb.cool/tencent/hunyuan/hunyuan-a13b:hunyuan-moe-A13B-trtllm\n```\n\nThen, rename the image to better align with the following scripts:\n```\n\ndocker tag docker.cnb.cool/tencent/hunyuan/hunyuan-a13b:hunyuan-moe-A13B-trtllm hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-a13b:hunyuan-moe-A13B-trtllm\n```\n\n\n- start docker \n\n```\ndocker run --name hunyuanLLM_infer --rm -it --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --gpus=all hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-a13b:hunyuan-moe-A13B-trtllm\n```\n\n- Prepare Configuration file:\n\n```\ncat >/path/to/extra-llm-api-config.yml <<EOF\nuse_cuda_graph: true\ncuda_graph_padding_enabled: true\ncuda_graph_batch_sizes:\n- 1\n- 2\n- 4\n- 8\n- 16\n- 32\nprint_iter_log: true\nEOF\n```\n\n\n- Start the API server:\n\n\n```\ntrtllm-serve \\n  /path/to/HunYuan-moe-A13B \\n  --host localhost \\n  --port 8000 \\n  --backend pytorch \\n  --max_batch_size 32 \\n  --max_num_tokens 16384 \\n  --tp_size 2 \\n  --kv_cache_free_gpu_memory_fraction 0.6 \\n  --trust_remote_code \\n  --extra_llm_api_options /path/to/extra-llm-api-config.yml\n```\n\n\n### vLLM\n\n#### Inference from Docker Image\nWe provide a pre-built Docker image containing vLLM 0.8.5 with full support for this model.

However, due to GPU memory constraints on most hardware setups, the default configuration in `config.json` limits the context length to **32K tokens** to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors.\n\n#### Extending Context Length to 256K\n\nTo enable full 256K context support, you can manually modify the `max_position_embeddings` field in the model''s `config.json` file as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  "max_position_embeddings": 262144,\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nWhen serving the model using **vLLM**, you can also explicitly set the maximum model length by adding the following flag to your server launch command:\n\n```bash\n--max-model-len 262144\n```\n\n#### Recommended Configuration for 256K Context Length\n\nThe following configuration is recommended for deploying the model with 256K context length support on systems equipped with **NVIDIA H20 GPUs (96GB VRAM)**:\n\n| Model DType    | KV-Cache Dtype | Number of Devices | Model Length |\n|----------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| `bfloat16`     | `bfloat16`     | 4                  | 262,144      |\n\n> ⚠️ **Note:** Using FP8 quantization for KV-cache may impact generation quality. The above settings are suggested configurations for stable 256K-length service deployment.\n\n\n#### Tool Calling with vLLM\n\nTo support agent-based workflows and function calling capabilities, this model includes specialized parsing mechanisms for handling tool calls and internal reasoning steps.\n\nFor a complete working example of how to implement and use these features in an agent setting, please refer to our full agent implementation on GitHub:  \n🔗 [Hunyuan A13B Agent Example](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan-A13B/blob/main/agent/)\n\nWhen deploying the model using **vLLM**, the following parameters can be used to configure the tool parsing behavior:\n\n| Parameter                | Value                                                                 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `--tool-parser-plugin`   | [Local Hunyuan A13B Tool Parser File](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan-A13B/blob/main/agent/hunyuan_tool_parser.py) |\n| `--tool-call-parser`     | `hunyuan`                                                            |\n\nThese settings enable vLLM to correctly interpret and route tool calls generated by the model according to the expected format.\n\n### Reasoning parser\n\nvLLM reasoning parser support on Hunyuan A13B model is under development.\n\n\n\n### SGLang\n\n#### Docker Image \n\nWe also provide a pre-built Docker image based on the latest version of SGLang.\n\nTo get started:\n\n- Pull the Docker image\n\n```\ndocker pull docker.cnb.cool/tencent/hunyuan/hunyuan-a13b:hunyuan-moe-A13B-sglang\nor\ndocker pull hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-a13b:hunyuan-moe-A13B-sglang\n```\n\n- Start the API server:\n\n```\ndocker run --gpus all \\n    --shm-size 32g \\n    -p 30000:30000 \\n    --ipc=host \\n    docker.cnb.cool/tencent/hunyuan/hunyuan-a13b:hunyuan-moe-A13B-sglang \\n    -m sglang.launch_server --model-path hunyuan/huanyuan_A13B --tp 4 --trust-remote-code --host 0.0.0.0 --port 30000\n```\n\n## Contact Us\n\nIf you would like to leave a message for our R&D and product teams, Welcome to contact our open-source team .

Tongyi Qianwen), proposed by Alibaba Cloud. Qwen-7B is a Transformer-based large language model, which is pretrained on a large volume of data, including web texts, books, codes, etc. Additionally, based on the pretrained Qwen-7B, we release Qwen-7B-Chat, a large-model-based AI assistant, which is trained with alignment techniques. Now we have updated both our pretrained and chat models with better performances. This repository is the one for Qwen-7B-Chat.\n\nFor more details about Qwen, please refer to the [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen) code repository.\n<br>\n\n## 要求（Requirements）\n\n* python 3.8及以上版本\n* pytorch 1.12及以上版本，推荐2.0及以上版本\n* 建议使用CUDA 11.4及以上（GPU用户、flash-attention用户等需考虑此选项）\n* python 3.8 and above\n* pytorch 1.12 and above, 2.0 and above are recommended\n* CUDA 11.4 and above are recommended (this is for GPU users, flash-attention users, etc.)\n<br>\n\n## 依赖项（Dependency）\n\n运行Qwen-7B-Chat，请确保满足上述要求，再执行以下pip命令安装依赖库\n\nTo run Qwen-7B-Chat, please make sure you meet the above requirements, and then execute the following pip commands to install the dependent libraries.\n\n```bash\npip install transformers==4.32.0 accelerate tiktoken einops scipy transformers_stream_generator==0.0.4 peft deepspeed\n```\n\n另外，推荐安装`flash-attention`库（**当前已支持flash attention 2**），以实现更高的效率和更低的显存占用。\n\nIn addition, it is recommended to install the `flash-attention` library (**we support flash attention 2 now.**) for higher efficiency and lower memory usage.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention\ncd flash-attention && pip install .\n# 下方安装可选，安装可能比较缓慢。\n# pip install csrc/layer_norm\n# pip install csrc/rotary\n```\n<br>\n\n## 快速使用（Quickstart）\n\n下面我们展示了一个使用Qwen-7B-Chat模型，进行多轮对话交互的样例：\n\nWe show an example of multi-turn interaction with Qwen-7B-Chat in the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nfrom transformers.generation import GenerationConfig\n\n# Note: The default behavior now has injection attack prevention off.\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat", trust_remote_code=True)\n\n# use bf16\n# model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat", device_map="auto", trust_remote_code=True, bf16=True).eval()\n# use fp16\n# model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat", device_map="auto", trust_remote_code=True, fp16=True).eval()\n# use cpu only\n# model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat", device_map="cpu", trust_remote_code=True).eval()\n# use auto mode, automatically select precision based on the device.\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat", device_map="auto", trust_remote_code=True).eval()\n\n# Specify hyperparameters for generation. But if you use transformers>=4.32.0, there is no need to do this.\n# model.generation_config = GenerationConfig.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat", trust_remote_code=True) # 可指定不同的生成长度、top_p等相关超参\n\n# 第一轮对话 1st dialogue turn\nresponse, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "你好", history=None)\nprint(response)\n# 你好！很高兴为你提供帮助。\n\n# 第二轮对话 2nd dialogue turn\nresponse, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "给我讲一个年轻人奋斗创业最终取得成功的故事。", history=history)\nprint(response)\n# 这是一个关于一个年轻人奋斗创业最终取得成功的故事。\n# 故事的主人公叫李明，他来自一个普通的家庭，父母都是普通的工人。从小，李明就立下了一个目标：要成为一名成功的企业家。\n# 为了实现这个目标，李明勤奋学习，考上了大学。在大学期间，他积极参加各种创业比赛，获得了不少奖项。他还利用课余时间去实习，积累了宝贵的经验。\n# 毕业后，李明决定开始自己的创业之路。他开始寻找投资机会，但多次都被拒绝了。然而，他并没有放弃。他继续努力，不断改进自己的创业计划，并寻找新的投资机会。\n# 最终，李明成功地获得了一笔投资，开始了自己的创业之路。他成立了一家科技公司，专注于开发新型软件。在他的领导下，公司迅速发展起来，成为了一家成功的科技企业。\n# 李明的成功并不是偶然的。他勤奋、坚韧、勇于冒险，不断学习和改进自己。他的成功也证明了，只要努力奋斗，任何人都有可能取得成功。\n\n# 第三轮对话 3rd dialogue turn\nresponse, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "给这个故事起一个标题", history=history)\nprint(response)\n# 《奋斗创业：一个年轻人的成功之路》\n```\n\n关于更多的使用说明，请参考我们的[GitHub repo](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen)获取更多信息。\n\nFor more information, please refer to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen) for more information.\n<br>\n\n## Tokenizer\n\n> 注：作为术语的“tokenization”在中文中尚无共识的概念对应，本文档采用英文表达以利说明。\n\n基于tiktoken的分词器有别于其他分词器，比如sentencepiece分词器。尤其在微调阶段，需要特别注意特殊token的使用。关于tokenizer的更多信息，以及微调时涉及的相关使用，请参阅[文档](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen/blob/main/tokenization_note_zh.md)。\n\nOur tokenizer based on tiktoken is different from other tokenizers, e.g., sentencepiece tokenizer. You need to pay attention to special tokens, especially in finetuning. For more detailed information on the tokenizer and related use in fine-tuning, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen/blob/main/tokenization_note.md).\n<br>\n\n## 量化 (Quantization)\n\n### 用法 (Usage)\n\n**请注意：我们更新量化方案为基于[AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ)的量化，提供Qwen-7B-Chat的Int4量化模型[点击这里](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat-Int4)。相比此前方案，该方案在模型评测效果几乎无损，且存储需求更低，推理速度更优。**\n\n**Note: we provide a new solution based on [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ), and release an Int4 quantized model for Qwen-7B-Chat [Click here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat-Int4), which achieves nearly lossless model effects but improved performance on both memory costs and inference speed, in comparison with the previous solution.**\n\n以下我们提供示例说明如何使用Int4量化模型。在开始使用前，请先保证满足要求（如torch 2.0及以上，transformers版本为4.32.0及以上，等等），并安装所需安装包：\n\nHere we demonstrate how to use our provided quantized models for inference. Before you start, make sure you meet the requirements of auto-gptq (e.g., torch 2.0 and above, transformers 4.32.0 and above, etc.) and install the required packages:\n\n```bash\npip install auto-gptq optimum\n```\n\n如安装`auto-gptq`遇到问题，我们建议您到官方[repo](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ)搜索合适的预编译wheel。\n\n随后即可使用和上述一致的用法调用量化模型：\n\nIf you meet problems installing `auto-gptq`, we advise you to check out the official [repo](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ) to find a pre-build wheel.\n\nThen you can load the quantized model easily and run inference as same as usual:\n\n```python\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    "Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat-Int4",\n    device_map="auto",\n    trust_remote_code=True\n).eval()\nresponse, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "你好", history=None)\n```\n\n\n\n### 效果评测\n\n我们对BF16，Int8和Int4模型在基准评测上做了测试（使用zero-shot设置），发现量化模型效果损失较小，结果如下所示：\n\nWe illustrate the zero-shot performance of both BF16, Int8 and Int4 models on the benchmark, and we find that the quantized model does not suffer from significant performance degradation. Results are shown below:\n\n|  Quantization |   MMLU     |  CEval (val) |  GSM8K |  Humaneval |\n| ------------- | :--------: | :----------: | :----: | :--------: |\n| BF16          |    55.8    |     59.7     |  50.3  |    37.2    |\n| Int8          |    55.4    |     59.4     |  48.3  |    34.8    |\n| Int4          |    55.1    |     59.2     |  49.7  |    29.9    |\n\n### 推理速度 (Inference Speed)\n\n我们测算了不同精度模型以及不同FlashAttn库版本下模型生成2048和8192个token的平均推理速度。如图所示：\n\nWe measured the average inference speed of generating 2048 and 8192 tokens with different quantization levels and versions of flash-attention, respectively.\n\n|  Quantization | FlashAttn | Speed (2048 tokens) | Speed (8192 tokens) |\n| ------------- | :-------: | :------------------:| :------------------:|\n|      BF16     |   v2      | 40.93               | 36.14               |\n|      Int8     |   v2      | 37.47               | 32.54               |\n|      Int4     |   v2      | 50.09               | 38.61               |\n|      BF16     |   v1      | 40.75               | 35.34               |\n|      Int8     |   v1      | 37.51               | 32.39               |\n|      Int4     |   v1      | 45.98               | 36.47               |\n|      BF16     |  Disabled | 37.55               | 33.56               |\n|      Int8     |  Disabled | 37.84               | 32.65               |\n|      Int4     |  Disabled | 48.12               | 36.70               |\n\n具体而言，我们记录在长度为1的上下文的条件下生成8192个token的性能。评测运行于单张A100-SXM4-80G GPU，使用PyTorch 2.0.1和CUDA 11.8。推理速度是生成8192个token的速度均值。\n\nIn detail, the setting of profiling is generating 8192 new tokens with 1 context token. The profiling runs on a single A100-SXM4-80G GPU with PyTorch 2.0.1 and CUDA 11.8. The inference speed is averaged over the generated 8192 tokens.\n\n注意：以上Int4/Int8模型生成速度使用autogptq库给出，当前``AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained``载入的模型生成速度会慢大约20%。我们已经将该问题汇报给HuggingFace团队，若有解决方案将即时更新。\n\nNote: The generation speed of the Int4/Int8 models mentioned above is provided by the autogptq library. The current speed of the model loaded using "AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained" will be approximately 20% slower. We have reported this issue to the HuggingFace team and will update it promptly if a solution is available.\n\n### 显存使用 (GPU Memory Usage)\n\n我们还测算了不同模型精度编码2048个token及生成8192个token的峰值显存占用情况。（显存消耗在是否使用FlashAttn的情况下均类似。）结果如下所示：\n\nWe also profile the peak GPU memory usage for encoding 2048 tokens as context (and generating single token) and generating 8192 tokens (with single token as context) under different quantization levels, respectively. （The GPU memory usage is similar when using flash-attention or not.）The results are shown below.\n\n| Quantization Level | Peak Usage for Encoding 2048 Tokens | Peak Usage for Generating 8192 Tokens |\n| ------------------ | :---------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: |\n| BF16               | 16.99GB                             | 22.53GB                               |\n| Int8               | 11.20GB                             | 16.62GB                               |\n| Int4               |  8.21GB                             | 13.63GB                               |\n\n上述性能测算使用[此脚本](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/profile.py)完成。\n\nThe above speed and memory profiling are conducted using [this script](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/profile.py).\n<br>\n\n## 模型细节（Model）\n\n与Qwen-7B预训练模型相同，Qwen-7B-Chat模型规模基本情况如下所示:\n\nThe details of the model architecture of Qwen-7B-Chat are listed as follows:\n\n| Hyperparameter  | Value  |\n|:----------------|:------:|\n| n_layers        |   32   |\n| n_heads         |   32   |\n| d_model         |  4096  |\n| vocab size      | 151851 |\n| sequence length |  8192  |\n\n在位置编码、FFN激活函数和normalization的实现方式上，我们也采用了目前最流行的做法，\n即RoPE相对位置编码、SwiGLU激活函数、RMSNorm（可选安装flash-attention加速）。\n\n在分词器方面，相比目前主流开源模型以中英词表为主，Qwen-7B-Chat使用了约15万token大小的词表。\n该词表在GPT-4使用的BPE词表`cl100k_base`基础上，对中文、多语言进行了优化，在对中、英、代码数据的高效编解码的基础上，对部分多语言更加友好，方便用户在不扩展词表的情况下对部分语种进行能力增强。\n词表对数字按单个数字位切分。调用较为高效的[tiktoken分词库](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)进行分词。\n\nFor position encoding, FFN activation function, and normalization calculation methods, we adopt the prevalent practices, i.e., RoPE relative position encoding, SwiGLU for activation function, and RMSNorm for normalization (optional installation of flash-attention for acceleration).\n\nFor tokenization, compared to the current mainstream open-source models based on Chinese and English vocabularies, Qwen-7B-Chat uses a vocabulary of over 150K tokens.\nIt first considers efficient encoding of Chinese, English, and code data, and is also more friendly to multilingual languages, enabling users to directly enhance the capability of some languages without expanding the vocabulary.\nIt segments numbers by single digit, and calls the [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) tokenizer library for efficient tokenization.\n<br>\n\n## 评测效果（Evaluation）\n\n对于Qwen-7B-Chat模型，我们同样评测了常规的中文理解（C-Eval）、英文理解（MMLU）、代码（HumanEval）和数学（GSM8K）等权威任务，同时包含了长序列任务的评测结果。由于Qwen-7B-Chat模型经过对齐后，激发了较强的外部系统调用能力，我们还进行了工具使用能力方面的评测。\n\n提示：由于硬件和框架造成的舍入误差，复现结果如有波动属于正常现象。\n\nFor Qwen-7B-Chat, we also evaluate the model on C-Eval, MMLU, HumanEval, GSM8K, etc., as well as the benchmark evaluation for long-context understanding, and tool usage.\n\nNote: Due to rounding errors caused by hardware and framework, differences in reproduced results are possible.\n\n### 中文评测（Chinese Evaluation）\n\n#### C-Eval\n\n在[C-Eval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08322)验证集上，我们评价了Qwen-7B-Chat模型的0-shot & 5-shot准确率\n\nWe demonstrate the 0-shot & 5-shot accuracy of Qwen-7B-Chat on C-Eval validation set\n\n|              Model               | Avg.

ReAct is also one of the main approaches used by the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) framework. In our evaluation benchmark for assessing tool usage capabilities, Qwen-Chat''s performance is as follows:\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th colspan="4" align="center">Chinese Tool-Use Benchmark</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th align="center">Model</th><th align="center">Tool Selection (Acc.↑)</th><th align="center">Tool Input (Rouge-L↑)</th><th align="center">False Positive Error↓</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>GPT-4</td><td align="center">95%</td><td align="center">0.90</td><td align="center">15.0%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>GPT-3.5</td><td align="center">85%</td><td align="center">0.88</td><td align="center">75.0%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Qwen-7B-Chat</td><td align="center">98%</td><td align="center">0.91</td><td align="center">7.3%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Qwen-14B-Chat</td><td align="center">98%</td><td align="center">0.93</td><td align="center">2.4%</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n> 评测基准中出现的插件均没有出现在千问的训练集中。该基准评估了模型在多个候选插件中选择正确插件的准确率、传入插件的参数的合理性、以及假阳率。假阳率（False Positive）定义：在处理不该调用插件的请求时，错误地调用了插件。\n\n> The plugins that appear in the evaluation set do not appear in the training set of Qwen. This benchmark evaluates the accuracy of the model in selecting the correct plugin from multiple candidate plugins, the rationality of the parameters passed into the plugin, and the false positive rate. False Positive: Incorrectly invoking a plugin when it should not have been called when responding to a query.\n\n![](assets/react_showcase_001.png)\n![](assets/react_showcase_002.png)\n\n#### Code Interpreter\n\n为了考察Qwen使用Python Code Interpreter完成数学解题、数据可视化、及文件处理与爬虫等任务的能力，我们专门建设并开源了一个评测这方面能力的[评测基准](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/tree/main/benchmark)。\n\n我们发现Qwen在生成代码的可执行率、结果正确性上均表现较好：\n\nTo assess Qwen''s ability to use the Python Code Interpreter for tasks such as mathematical problem solving, data visualization, and other general-purpose tasks such as file handling and web scraping, we have created and open-sourced a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating these capabilities. You can find the benchmark at this [link](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/tree/main/benchmark).\n\nWe have observed that Qwen performs well in terms of code executability and result accuracy when generating code:\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th colspan="4" align="center">Executable Rate of Generated Code (%)</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th align="center">Model</th><th align="center">Math↑</th><th align="center">Visualization↑</th><th align="center">General↑</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>GPT-4</td><td align="center">91.9</td><td align="center">85.9</td><td align="center">82.8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>GPT-3.5</td><td align="center">89.2</td><td align="center">65.0</td><td align="center">74.1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>LLaMA2-7B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">41.9</td>\n        <td align="center">33.1</td>\n        <td align="center">24.1 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>LLaMA2-13B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">50.0</td>\n        <td align="center">40.5</td>\n        <td align="center">48.3 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>CodeLLaMA-7B-Instruct</td>\n        <td align="center">85.1</td>\n        <td align="center">54.0</td>\n        <td align="center">70.7 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>CodeLLaMA-13B-Instruct</td>\n        <td align="center">93.2</td>\n        <td align="center">55.8</td>\n        <td align="center">74.1 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>InternLM-7B-Chat-v1.1</td>\n        <td align="center">78.4</td>\n        <td align="center">44.2</td>\n        <td align="center">62.1 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>InternLM-20B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">70.3</td>\n        <td align="center">44.2</td>\n        <td align="center">65.5 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Qwen-7B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">82.4</td>\n        <td align="center">64.4</td>\n        <td align="center">67.2 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Qwen-14B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">89.2</td>\n        <td align="center">84.1</td>\n        <td align="center">65.5</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th colspan="4" align="center">Accuracy of Code Execution Results (%)</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th align="center">Model</th><th align="center">Math↑</th><th align="center">Visualization-Hard↑</th><th align="center">Visualization-Easy↑</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>GPT-4</td><td align="center">82.8</td><td align="center">66.7</td><td align="center">60.8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>GPT-3.5</td><td align="center">47.3</td><td align="center">33.3</td><td align="center">55.7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>LLaMA2-7B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">3.9</td>\n        <td align="center">14.3</td>\n        <td align="center">39.2 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>LLaMA2-13B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">8.3</td>\n        <td align="center">8.3</td>\n        <td align="center">40.5 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>CodeLLaMA-7B-Instruct</td>\n        <td align="center">14.3</td>\n        <td align="center">26.2</td>\n        <td align="center">60.8 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>CodeLLaMA-13B-Instruct</td>\n        <td align="center">28.2</td>\n        <td align="center">27.4</td>\n        <td align="center">62.0 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>InternLM-7B-Chat-v1.1</td>\n        <td align="center">28.5</td>\n        <td align="center">4.8</td>\n        <td align="center">40.5 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>InternLM-20B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">34.6</td>\n        <td align="center">21.4</td>\n        <td align="center">45.6 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Qwen-7B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">41.9</td>\n        <td align="center">40.5</td>\n        <td align="center">54.4 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Qwen-14B-Chat</td>\n        <td align="center">58.4</td>\n        <td align="center">53.6</td>\n        <td align="center">59.5</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p align="center">\n    <br>\n    <img src="assets/code_interpreter_showcase_001.jpg" />\n    <br>\n<p>\n\n#### Huggingface Agent\n\n千问还具备作为 [HuggingFace Agent](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/transformers_agents) 的能力。它在 Huggingface 提供的run模式评测基准上的表现如下：\n\nQwen-Chat also has the capability to be used as a [HuggingFace Agent](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/transformers_agents).

We experimentally offer quantile heads but they have not been calibrated after pretraining.\n- It requires the context to be contiguous (i.e. no "holes"), and the context and the horizon to be of the same frequency.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nPlease refer to our result tables on the [extended benchmarks](https://github.com/google-research/timesfm/blob/master/experiments/extended_benchmarks/tfm_results.png) and the [long horizon benchmarks](https://github.com/google-research/timesfm/blob/master/experiments/long_horizon_benchmarks/tfm_long_horizon.png).\n\nPlease look into the README files in the respective benchmark directories within `experiments/` for instructions for running TimesFM on the respective benchmarks.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis HuggingFace repo hosts TimesFm checkpoints. Please visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/google-research/timesfm) and follow the instructions there to install the `timesfm` library for model inference.\n\nIn particular, the dependency `lingvo` does not support ARM architectures and the inference code is not working for machines with Apple silicon. We are aware of this issue and are working on a solution. Stay tuned.\n\n## Usage \n\n### Initialize the model and load a checkpoint.\nThen the base class can be loaded as,\n\n```python\nimport timesfm\n\ntfm = timesfm.TimesFm(\n    context_len=<context>,\n    horizon_len=<horizon>,\n    input_patch_len=32,\n    output_patch_len=128,\n    num_layers=20,\n    model_dims=1280,\n    backend=<backend>,\n)\ntfm.load_from_checkpoint(repo_id="google/timesfm-1.0-200m")\n```\n\nNote that the four parameters are fixed to load the 200m model\n\n```python\ninput_patch_len=32,\noutput_patch_len=128,\nnum_layers=20,\nmodel_dims=1280,\n```\n\n1. The context_len here can be set as the max context length **of the model**. You can provide a shorter series to the `tfm.forecast()` function and the model will handle it. Currently, the model handles a max context length of 512, which can be increased in later releases. The input time series can have **any context length**. Padding / truncation will be handled by the inference code if needed.\n\n2. The horizon length can be set to anything. We recommend setting it to the largest horizon length you would need in the forecasting tasks for your application. We generally recommend horizon length <= context length but it is not a requirement in the function call.\n\n### Perform inference\n\nWe provide APIs to forecast from either array inputs or `pandas` dataframe. Both forecast methods expect (1) the input time series contexts, (2) along with their frequencies. Please look at the documentation of the functions `tfm.forecast()` and `tfm.forecast_on_df()` for detailed instructions.\n\nIn particular, regarding the frequency, TimesFM expects a categorical indicator valued in {0, 1, 2}:\n\n- **0** (default): high frequency, long horizon time series. We recommend using this for time series up to daily granularity.\n- **1**: medium frequency time series. We recommend using this for weekly and monthly data.\n- **2**: low frequency, short horizon time series. We recommend using this for anything beyond monthly, e.g. quarterly or yearly.\n\nThis categorical value should be directly provided with the array inputs. For dataframe inputs, we convert the conventional letter coding of frequencies to our expected categories, that\n\n- **0**: T, MIN, H, D, B, U\n- **1**: W, M\n- **2**: Q, Y\n\nNotice you do **NOT** have to strictly follow our recommendation here. Although this is our setup during model training and we expect it to offer the best forecast result, you can also view the frequency input as a free parameter and modify it per your specific use case.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nArray inputs, with the frequencies set to low, medium, and high respectively.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nforecast_input = [\n    np.sin(np.linspace(0, 20, 100))\n    np.sin(np.linspace(0, 20, 200)),\n    np.sin(np.linspace(0, 20, 400)),\n]\nfrequency_input = [0, 1, 2]\n\npoint_forecast, experimental_quantile_forecast = tfm.forecast(\n    forecast_input,\n    freq=frequency_input,\n)\n```\n\n`pandas` dataframe, with the frequency set to "M" monthly.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# e.g. input_df is\n#       unique_id  ds          y\n# 0     T1         1975-12-31  697458.0\n# 1     T1         1976-01-31  1187650.0\n# 2     T1         1976-02-29  1069690.0\n# 3     T1         1976-03-31  1078430.0\n# 4     T1         1976-04-30  1059910.0\n# ...   ...        ...         ...\n# 8175  T99        1986-01-31  602.0\n# 8176  T99        1986-02-28  684.0\n# 8177  T99        1986-03-31  818.0\n# 8178  T99        1986-04-30  836.0\n# 8179  T99        1986-05-31  878.0\n\nforecast_df = tfm.forecast_on_df(\n    inputs=input_df,\n    freq="M",  # monthly\n    value_name="y",\n    num_jobs=-1,\n)\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"time-series-forecasting","library_name":"timesfm","framework":"timesfm","params":null,"storage_bytes":814291152,"files_count":5,"spaces_count":4,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":null}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:timesfm","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/timesfm"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:timesfm","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/timesfm"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:timesfm","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/timesfm"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:timesfm","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/timesfm"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2310.10688","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10688"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 63.9, '787c584aa80c6e00bc16f8ee24933613', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. \n\nIn this repo, we are open-sourcing NVLM-1.0-D-72B (decoder-only architecture), the decoder-only model weights and code for the community.\n\n\n\n## Reference(s)\n[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402) &ensp; [Inference Code (HF)](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVLM-D-72B/tree/main) &ensp; [Training Code](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/NVLM-1.0/examples/multimodal/nvlm) &ensp; [Website](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/NVLM-1/) \n\n## Benchmark Results\nWe train our model with legacy [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/legacy) and adapt the codebase to Huggingface for model hosting, reproducibility, and inference.\nWe observe numerical differences between the Megatron and Huggingface codebases, which are within the expected range of variation. \nWe provide the results from both the Huggingface codebase and the Megatron codebase for reproducibility and comparison with other models.\n\nResults (as of September 17th, 2024) in the multimodal benchmarks are as follows:\n\n### Vision-language Benchmarks \n\n| Benchmark                    | MMMU (val / test) | MathVista | OCRBench | AI2D | ChartQA | DocVQA | TextVQA | RealWorldQA | VQAv2 |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|----------|------|---------|--------|---------|-------------|-------|\n| NVLM-D 1.0 72B (Huggingface) | 58.7 / 54.9       | 65.2      | 852      | 94.2 | 86.0    | 92.6   | 82.6    | 69.5        | 85.4  |\n| NVLM-D 1.0 72B (Megatron)    | 59.7 / 54.6       | 65.2      | 853      | 94.2 | 86.0    | 92.6   | 82.1    | 69.7        | 85.4  |\n| Llama 3.2 90B                | 60.3 / -          | 57.3      | -        | 92.3 | 85.5    | 90.1   | -       | -           | 78.1  |\n| Llama 3-V 70B                | 60.6 / -          | -         | -        | 93.0 | 83.2    | 92.2   | 83.4    | -           | 79.1  |\n| Llama 3-V 405B               | 64.5 / -          | -         | -        | 94.1 | 85.8    | 92.6   | 84.8    | -           | 80.2  |\n| InternVL2-Llama3-76B         | 55.2 / -          | 65.5      | 839      | 94.8 | 88.4    | 94.1   | 84.4    | 72.2        | -     |\n| GPT-4V                       | 56.8 / 55.7       | 49.9      | 645      | 78.2 | 78.5    | 88.4   | 78.0    | 61.4        | 77.2  |\n| GPT-4o                       | 69.1 / -          | 63.8      | 736      | 94.2 | 85.7    | 92.8   | -       | -           | -     |\n| Claude 3.5 Sonnet            | 68.3 / -          | 67.7      | 788      | 94.7 | 90.8    | 95.2   | -       | -           | -     |\n| Gemini 1.5 Pro (Aug 2024)    | 62.2 / -          | 63.9      | 754      | 94.4 | 87.2    | 93.1   | 78.7    | 70.4        | 80.2  |\n\n### Text-only Benchmarks\n\n| Tasks                        | Backbone LLM | MMLU | GSM8K | MATH | HumanEval | Avg.

The model has no image generation capability since its output is only text. Hence it cannot regenerate any image it would have seen during training.\n\n2. The model cannot regenerate training text data: during training, the model takes text and images as inputs, and the model output (text) is conditioned on both inputs. During inference, without training images as input, the models would not be able to reproduce any part of the training text data.\n\n\n### Input\n**Input Type(s):** Text, Image <br>\n**Input Format(s):** String, [Pillow Library-Supported Formats](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html) <br>\n**Input Dimensions:** One-Dimensional (1D), Two Dimensional (2D) <br>\n**Other Properties Related to Input:** Maximum Token Length = 128K Tokens <br>\n\n### Output\n**Output Type(s):** Text <br>\n**Output Format:** String <br>\n**Model Output:** 1D <br>\n**Other Properties Related to Output:** None <br> \n\n## How to use\n\nWhen converting Megatron checkpoint to Huggingface, we adapt [InternVL codebase](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL2-Llama3-76B) to support model loading and multi-GPU inference in HF. \nWe also use the tokenizer from [Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct/tree/main) when adapting the tokenizer to Huggingface, as it contains extra special tokens for vision tasks, e.g., `<|vision_pad|>`. \nWe train NVLM-1.0-D-72B based on the [Qwen2-72B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct/tree/main) text-only model and [InternViT-6B-448px-V1-5](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternViT-6B-448px-V1-5) ViT model with our large-scale high-quality multimodal dataset. \nFor training code, please refer to [Megatron-Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/NVLM-1.0/examples/multimodal/nvlm).\n\n\n### Prepare the environment\n\nWe provide a docker build file in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for reproduction. \n\nThe docker image is based on `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.09-py3`. \n\n*Note: We observe that different transformer versions / CUDA versions / docker versions can lead to slight benchmark number differences. We recommend using the Dockerfile above for precise reproduction.*\n\n### Model loading\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\n\npath = "nvidia/NVLM-D-72B"\nmodel =

\\n --result-save-path path/to/eval_results/ \\n --zero-shot-eval-tasks chartqa coco_caption flickr30k_caption vqav2 mmmu textvqa mathvista mmbench chartqa docvqa realworldqa ocrbench ai2diagram ai2diagram_nomask mmmu_pro docvqa_test\n```\n\nSpecifically,\n- `--config-path eval/full_eval.yaml` file contains the evaluation configurations, including  the evaluation prompt, the evaluation dataset paths, and generation hyper-parameters.\n- `--result-save-path path/to/eval_results/` specifies the path to save the evaluation results.\n- `--zero-shot-eval-tasks` specifies the tasks to evaluate on.\n\n\n## Software Integration\n**Runtime Engine(s)** \n* PyTorch <br>\n\n**Supported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:** <br>\n* NVIDIA Hopper <br>\n\n**[Preferred/Supported]

It was introduced in the paper [Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116) by Conneau et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/xlmr). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing XLM-RoBERTa did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nXLM-RoBERTa is a multilingual version of RoBERTa. It is pre-trained on 2.5TB of filtered CommonCrawl data containing 100 languages. \n\nRoBERTa is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts.\n\nMore precisely, it was pretrained with the Masked language modeling (MLM) objective. Taking a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of 100 languages that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a standard classifier using the features produced by the XLM-RoBERTa model as inputs.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for masked language modeling, but it''s mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=xlm-roberta) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked) to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text generation, you should look at models like GPT2.\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline(''fill-mask'', model=''xlm-roberta-base'')\n>>> unmasker("Hello I''m a <mask> model.")\n\n[{''score'': 0.10563907772302628,\n  ''sequence'': "Hello I''m a fashion model.",\n  ''token'': 54543,\n  ''token_str'': ''fashion''},\n {''score'': 0.08015287667512894,\n  ''sequence'': "Hello I''m a new model.",\n  ''token'': 3525,\n  ''token_str'': ''new''},\n {''score'': 0.033413201570510864,\n  ''sequence'': "Hello I''m a model model.",\n  ''token'': 3299,\n  ''token_str'': ''model''},\n {''score'': 0.030217764899134636,\n  ''sequence'': "Hello I''m a French model.",\n  ''token'': 92265,\n  ''token_str'': ''French''},\n {''score'': 0.026436051353812218,\n  ''sequence'': "Hello I''m a sexy model.",\n  ''token'': 17473,\n  ''token_str'': ''sexy''}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForMaskedLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(''xlm-roberta-base'')\nmodel = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("xlm-roberta-base")\n\n# prepare input\ntext = "Replace me by any text you''d like."\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=''pt'')\n\n# forward pass\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1911-02116,\n  author    = {Alexis Conneau and\n               Kartikay Khandelwal and\n               Naman Goyal and\n               Vishrav Chaudhary and\n               Guillaume Wenzek and\n               Francisco Guzm{\''{a}}n and\n               Edouard Grave and\n               Myle Ott and\n               Luke Zettlemoyer and\n               Veselin Stoyanov},\n  title     = {Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1911.02116},\n  year      = {2019},\n  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116},\n  eprinttype = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {1911.02116},\n  timestamp = {Mon, 11 Nov 2019 18:38:09 +0100},\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-1911-02116.bib},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```\n\n<a href="https://huggingface.co/exbert/?model=xlm-roberta-base">\n	<img width="300px" src="https://cdn-media.huggingface.co/exbert/button.png">\n</a>\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"fill-mask","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":278885778,"storage_bytes":6352424687,"files_count":11,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["XLMRobertaForMaskedLM"],"model_type":"xlm-roberta","tokenizer_config":{}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:pytorch:fairseq","source_url":"https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:1911.02116","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 63.9, '1fba0749c413cab557edb8d815166b93', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

By modeling speech in a continuous space, it overcomes the limitations of discrete tokenization and enables two flagship capabilities: context-aware speech generation and true-to-life zero-shot voice cloning.\n\nUnlike mainstream approaches that convert speech to discrete tokens, VoxCPM uses an end-to-end diffusion autoregressive architecture that directly generates continuous speech representations from text. Built on [MiniCPM-4](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4-0.5B) backbone, it achieves implicit semantic-acoustic decoupling through hierachical language modeling and FSQ constraints, greatly enhancing both expressiveness and generation stability.\n\n<div align="center">\n  <img src="assets/voxcpm_model.png" alt="VoxCPM Model Architecture" width="90%">\n</div>\n\n\n###  🚀 Key Features\n- **Context-Aware, Expressive Speech Generation** - VoxCPM comprehends text to infer and generate appropriate prosody, delivering speech with remarkable expressiveness and natural flow. It spontaneously adapts speaking style based on content, producing highly fitting vocal expression trained on a massive 1.8 million-hour bilingual corpus.\n- **True-to-Life Voice Cloning** - With only a short reference audio clip, VoxCPM performs accurate zero-shot voice cloning, capturing not only the speaker’s timbre but also fine-grained characteristics such as accent, emotional tone, rhythm, and pacing to create a faithful and natural replica.\n- **High-Efficiency Synthesis** - VoxCPM supports streaming synthesis with a Real-Time Factor (RTF) as low as 0.17 on a consumer-grade NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, making it possible for real-time applications.\n\n\n##  Quick Start\n\n### 🔧 Install from PyPI\n``` sh\npip install voxcpm\n```\n### 1.

Follow this recipe to cook up perfect generated speech. Let’s begin.\n\n---\n### 🥚 Step 1: Prepare Your Base Ingredients (Content)\n\nFirst, choose how you’d like to input your text:.\n1. Regular Text (Classic Mode)\n- ✅ Keep "Text Normalization" ON. Type naturally (e.g., "Hello, world! 123"). The system will automatically process numbers, abbreviations, and punctuation using WeTextProcessing library.\n2. Phoneme Input (Native Mode)\n- ❌ Turn "Text Normalization" OFF. Enter phoneme text like {HH AH0 L OW1} (EN) or {ni3}{hao3} (ZH) for precise pronunciation  control. In this mode, VoxCPM also supports native understanding of other complex non-normalized text—try it out!\n\n---\n### 🍳 Step 2: Choose Your Flavor Profile (Voice Style) \n\nThis is the secret sauce that gives your audio its unique sound.\n1. Cooking with a Prompt Speech (Following a Famous Recipe)\n  - A prompt speech provides the desired acoustic characteristics for VoxCPM. The speaker''s timbre, speaking style, and even the background sounds and ambiance will be replicated.\n  - For a Clean, Studio-Quality Voice:\n    - ✅ Enable "Prompt Speech Enhancement". This acts like a noise filter, removing background hiss and rumble to give you a pure, clean voice clone.\n2. Cooking au Naturel (Letting the Model Improvise)\n  - If no reference is provided, VoxCPM becomes a creative chef! It will infer a fitting speaking style based on the text itself, thanks to the text-smartness of its foundation model, MiniCPM-4.\n  - Pro Tip: Challenge VoxCPM with any text—poetry, song lyrics, dramatic monologues—it may deliver some interesting results!\n\n---\n### 🧂 Step 3: The Final Seasoning (Fine-Tuning Your Results)\nYou''re ready to serve! But for master chefs who want to tweak the flavor, here are two key spices.\n- CFG Value (How Closely to Follow the Recipe)\n  - Default: A great starting point.\n  - Voice sounds strained or weird? Lower this value. It tells the model to be more relaxed and improvisational, great for expressive prompts.\n  - Need maximum clarity and adherence to the text? Raise it slightly to keep the model on a tighter leash.\n- Inference Timesteps (Simmering Time: Quality vs. Speed)\n  - Need a quick snack? Use a lower number. Perfect for fast drafts and experiments.\n  - Cooking a gourmet meal? Use a higher number. This lets the model "simmer" longer, refining the audio for superior detail and naturalness.\n\n---\nHappy creating! 🎉 Start with the default settings and tweak from there to suit your project. The kitchen is yours!\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 📊 Performance Highlights\n\nVoxCPM achieves competitive results on public zero-shot TTS benchmarks:\n\n### Seed-TTS-eval Benchmark\n\n| Model | Parameters | Open-Source | test-EN | | test-ZH | | test-Hard | |\n|------|------|------|:------------:|:--:|:------------:|:--:|:-------------:|:--:|\n| | | | WER/%⬇ | SIM/%⬆| CER/%⬇| SIM/%⬆ | CER/%⬇ | SIM/%⬆ |\n| MegaTTS3 | 0.5B | ❌ | 2.79 | 77.1 | 1.52 | 79.0 | - | - |\n| DiTAR | 0.6B | ❌ | 1.69 | 73.5 | 1.02 | 75.3 | - | - |\n| CosyVoice3 | 0.5B | ❌ | 2.02 | 71.8 | 1.16 | 78.0 | 6.08 | 75.8 |\n| CosyVoice3 | 1.5B | ❌ | 2.22 | 72.0 | 1.12 | 78.1 | 5.83 | 75.8 |\n| Seed-TTS | - | ❌ | 2.25 | 76.2 | 1.12 | 79.6 | 7.59 | 77.6 |\n| MiniMax-Speech | - | ❌ | 1.65 | 69.2 | 0.83 | 78.3 | - | - |\n| CosyVoice | 0.3B | ✅ | 4.29 | 60.9 | 3.63 | 72.3 | 11.75 | 70.9 |\n| CosyVoice2 | 0.5B | ✅ | 3.09 | 65.9 | 1.38 | 75.7 | **6.83** | 72.4 |\n| F5-TTS | 0.3B | ✅ | 2.00 | 67.0 | 1.53 | 76.0 | 8.67 | 71.3 |\n| SparkTTS | 0.5B | ✅ | 3.14 | 57.3 | 1.54 | 66.0 | - | - |\n| FireRedTTS | 0.5B | ✅ | 3.82 | 46.0 | 1.51 | 63.5 | 17.45 | 62.1 |\n| FireRedTTS-2 | 1.5B | ✅ | 1.95 | 66.5 | 1.14 | 73.6 | - | - |\n| Qwen2.5-Omni | 7B | ✅ | 2.72 | 63.2 | 1.70 | 75.2 | 7.97 | **74.7** |\n| OpenAudio-s1-mini | 0.5B | ✅ | 1.94 | 55.0 | 1.18 | 68.5 | - | - |\n| IndexTTS2 | 1.5B | ✅ | 2.23 | 70.6 | 1.03 | 76.5 | - | - |\n| VibeVoice | 1.5B | ✅ | 3.04 | 68.9 | 1.16 | 74.4 | - | - |\n| HiggsAudio-v2 | 3B | ✅ | 2.44 | 67.7 | 1.50 | 74.0 | - | - |\n| **VoxCPM** | 0.5B | ✅ | **1.85** | **72.9** | **0.93** | **77.2** | 8.87 | 73.0 |\n\n\n###  CV3-eval Benchmark\n\n| Model | zh | en | hard-zh | | | hard-en | | |\n|-------|:--:|:--:|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:-------:|:--:|:--:|\n| | CER/%⬇ | WER/%⬇ | CER/%⬇ | SIM/%⬆ | DNSMOS⬆ | WER/%⬇ | SIM/%⬆ | DNSMOS⬆ |\n| F5-TTS | 5.47 | 8.90 | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| SparkTTS | 5.15 | 11.0 | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| GPT-SoVits | 7.34 | 12.5 | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| CosyVoice2 | 4.08 | 6.32 | 12.58 | 72.6 | 3.81 | 11.96 | 66.7 | 3.95 |\n| OpenAudio-s1-mini | 4.00 | 5.54 | 18.1 | 58.2 | 3.77 | 12.4 | 55.7 | 3.89 |\n| IndexTTS2 | 3.58 | 4.45 | 12.8 | 74.6 | 3.65 | - | - | - |\n| HiggsAudio-v2 | 9.54 | 7.89 | 41.0 | 60.2 | 3.39 | 10.3 | 61.8 | 3.68 |\n| CosyVoice3-0.5B | 3.89 | 5.24 | 14.15 | 78.6 | 3.75 | 9.04 | 75.9 | 3.92 |\n| CosyVoice3-1.5B | 3.91 | 4.99 | 9.77 | 78.5 | 3.79 | 10.55 | 76.1 | 3.95 |\n| **VoxCPM** | **3.40** | **4.04** | 12.9 | 66.1 | 3.59 | **7.89** | 64.3 | 3.74 |\n\n\n## ⚠️ Risks and limitations\n- General Model Behavior: While VoxCPM has been trained on a large-scale dataset, it may still produce outputs that are unexpected, biased, or contain artifacts.\n- Potential for Misuse of Voice Cloning: VoxCPM''s powerful zero-shot voice cloning capability can generate highly realistic synthetic speech. This technology could be misused for creating convincing deepfakes for purposes of impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users of this model must not use it to create content that infringes upon the rights of individuals. It is strictly forbidden to use VoxCPM for any illegal or unethical purposes. We strongly recommend that any publicly shared content generated with this model be clearly marked as AI-generated.\n- Current Technical Limitations: Although generally stable, the model may occasionally exhibit instability, especially with very long or expressive inputs. Furthermore, the current version offers limited direct control over specific speech attributes like emotion or speaking style.\n- Bilingual Model: VoxCPM is trained primarily on Chinese and English data. Performance on other languages is not guaranteed and may result in unpredictable or low-quality audio.\n- This model is released for research and development purposes only.

Building upon the dense foundational models of the Qwen3 series, it provides a comprehensive range of text embeddings and reranking models in various sizes (0.6B, 4B, and 8B). This series inherits the exceptional multilingual capabilities, long-text understanding, and reasoning skills of its foundational model. The Qwen3 Embedding series represents significant advancements in multiple text embedding and ranking tasks, including text retrieval, code retrieval, text classification, text clustering, and bitext mining.\n\n**Exceptional Versatility**: The embedding model has achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of downstream application evaluations. The 8B size embedding model ranks **No.1** in the MTEB multilingual leaderboard (as of June 5, 2025, score **70.58**), while the reranking model excels in various text retrieval scenarios.\n\n**Comprehensive Flexibility**: The Qwen3 Embedding series offers a full spectrum of sizes (from 0.6B to 8B) for both embedding and reranking models, catering to diverse use cases that prioritize efficiency and effectiveness. Developers can seamlessly combine these two modules. Additionally, the embedding model allows for flexible vector definitions across all dimensions, and both embedding and reranking models support user-defined instructions to enhance performance for specific tasks, languages, or scenarios.\n\n**Multilingual Capability**: The Qwen3 Embedding series offer support for over 100 languages, thanks to the multilingual capabilites of Qwen3 models. This includes various programming languages, and provides robust multilingual, cross-lingual, and code retrieval capabilities.\n\n## Model Overview\n\n**Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B** has the following features:\n\n- Model Type: Text Embedding\n- Supported Languages: 100+ Languages\n- Number of Paramaters: 0.6B\n- Context Length: 32k\n- Embedding Dimension: Up to 1024, supports user-defined output dimensions ranging from 32 to 1024\n\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-embedding/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Embedding).\n\n## Qwen3 Embedding Series Model list\n\n| Model Type       | Models               | Size | Layers | Sequence Length | Embedding Dimension | MRL Support | Instruction Aware |\n|------------------|----------------------|------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Text Embedding   | [Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B) | 0.6B | 28     | 32K             | 1024                | Yes         | Yes            |\n| Text Embedding   | [Qwen3-Embedding-4B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B)   | 4B   | 36     | 32K             | 2560                | Yes         | Yes            |\n| Text Embedding   | [Qwen3-Embedding-8B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B)   | 8B   | 36     | 32K             | 4096                | Yes         | Yes            |\n| Text Reranking   | [Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B) | 0.6B | 28     | 32K             | -                   | -           | Yes            |\n| Text Reranking   | [Qwen3-Reranker-4B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-4B)   | 4B   | 36     | 32K             | -                   | -           | Yes            |\n| Text Reranking   | [Qwen3-Reranker-8B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-8B)   | 8B   | 36     | 32K             | -                   | -           | Yes            |\n\n> **Note**:\n> - `MRL Support` indicates whether the embedding model supports custom dimensions for the final embedding. \n> - `Instruction Aware` notes whether the embedding or reranking model supports customizing the input instruction according to different tasks.\n> - Our evaluation indicates that, for most downstream tasks, using instructions (instruct) typically yields an improvement of 1% to 5% compared to not using them. Therefore, we recommend that developers create tailored instructions specific to their tasks and scenarios. In multilingual contexts, we also advise users to write their instructions in English, as most instructions utilized during the model training process were originally written in English.\n\n## Usage\n\nWith Transformers versions earlier than 4.51.0, you may encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen3''\n```\n\n### Sentence Transformers Usage\n\n```python\n# Requires transformers>=4.51.0\n# Requires sentence-transformers>=2.7.0\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\n# Load the model\nmodel = SentenceTransformer("Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B")\n\n# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving,\n# together with setting `padding_side` to "left":\n# model = SentenceTransformer(\n#     "Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B",\n#     model_kwargs={"attn_implementation": "flash_attention_2", "device_map": "auto"},\n#     tokenizer_kwargs={"padding_side": "left"},\n# )\n\n# The queries and documents to embed\nqueries = [\n    "What is the capital of China?",\n    "Explain gravity",\n]\ndocuments = [\n    "The capital of China is Beijing.",\n    "Gravity is a force that attracts two bodies towards each other.

Our tests have shown that in most retrieval scenarios, not using an `instruct` on the query side can lead to a drop in retrieval performance by approximately 1% to 5%.\n\n### Text Embeddings Inference (TEI) Usage\n\nYou can either run / deploy TEI on NVIDIA GPUs as:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v hf_cache:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:cpu-1.7.2 --model-id Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B --dtype float16\n```\n\nOr on CPU devices as:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 8080:80 -v hf_cache:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.7.2 --model-id Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B\n```\n\nAnd then, generate the embeddings sending a HTTP POST request as:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:8080/embed \\n    -X POST \\n    -d ''{"inputs": ["Instruct: Given a web search query, retrieve relevant passages that answer the query\nQuery: What is the capital of China?", "Instruct: Given a web search query, retrieve relevant passages that answer the query\nQuery: Explain gravity"]}'' \\n    -H "Content-Type: application/json"\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\n### MTEB (Multilingual)\n\n| Model                            |  Size   |  Mean (Task)  | Mean (Type) | Bitxt Mining | Class. | Clust. | Inst.

installed:\n\n```\npip install -U text2vec\n```\n\nThen you can use the model like this:\n\n```python\nfrom text2vec import SentenceModel\nsentences = [''如何更换花呗绑定银行卡'', ''花呗更改绑定银行卡'']\n\nmodel = SentenceModel(''shibing624/text2vec-base-chinese'')\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers)\nWithout [text2vec](https://github.com/shibing624/text2vec), you can use the model like this: \n\nFirst, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings.\n\nInstall transformers:\n```\npip install transformers\n```\n\nThen load model and predict:\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel\nimport torch\n\n# Mean Pooling - Take attention mask into account for correct averaging\ndef mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):\n    token_embeddings = model_output[0]  # First element of model_output contains all token embeddings\n    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()\n    return torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)\n\n# Load model from HuggingFace Hub\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(''shibing624/text2vec-base-chinese'')\nmodel

by adapting the Evol-Instruct method specifically for coding tasks. This involves tailoring the prompt to the domain of code-related instructions. Subsequently, we fine-tune the Code LLM, StarCoder, utilizing the newly created instruction-following training set.\n\n## News\n\n- 🔥 Our **WizardCoder-15B-v1.0** model achieves the **57.3 pass@1** on the [HumanEval Benchmarks](https://github.com/openai/human-eval), which is **22.3** points higher than the SOTA open-source Code LLMs.\n- 🔥 We released **WizardCoder-15B-v1.0** trained with **78k** evolved code instructions. Please checkout the [Model Weights](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-15B-V1.0), and [Paper]().\n- &#x1F4E3; Please refer to our Twitter account https://twitter.com/WizardLM_AI and HuggingFace Repo https://huggingface.co/WizardLM . We will use them to announce any new release at the 1st time. \n\n\n## Comparing WizardCoder with the Closed-Source Models.\n\n\n🔥 The following figure shows that our **WizardCoder attains the third position in this benchmark**, surpassing Claude-Plus (59.8 vs. 53.0) and Bard (59.8 vs. 44.5). Notably, our model exhibits a substantially smaller size compared to these models.\n\n<p align="center" width="100%">\n<a ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/main/WizardCoder/imgs/pass1.png" alt="WizardCoder" style="width: 86%; min-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>\n</p>\n\n❗**Note: In this study, we copy the scores for HumanEval and HumanEval+ from the [LLM-Humaneval-Benchmarks](https://github.com/my-other-github-account/llm-humaneval-benchmarks). Notably, all the mentioned models generate code solutions for each problem utilizing a **single attempt**, and the resulting pass rate percentage is reported. Our **WizardCoder** generates answers using greedy decoding and tests with the same [code](https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus).**\n\n## Comparing WizardCoder with the Open-Source Models.\n\nThe following table clearly demonstrates that our **WizardCoder** exhibits a substantial performance advantage over all the open-source models. ❗**If you are confused with the different scores of our model (57.3 and 59.8), please check the Notes.**\n\n\n| Model            | HumanEval Pass@1 | MBPP Pass@1 |\n|------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| CodeGen-16B-Multi| 18.3             |20.9         |\n| CodeGeeX         | 22.9             |24.4         |\n| LLaMA-33B        | 21.7             |30.2         |\n| LLaMA-65B        | 23.7             |37.7         |\n| PaLM-540B        | 26.2             |36.8         |\n| PaLM-Coder-540B  | 36.0             |47.0         |\n| PaLM 2-S         | 37.6             |50.0         |\n| CodeGen-16B-Mono | 29.3             |35.3         |\n| Code-Cushman-001 | 33.5             |45.9         |\n| StarCoder-15B    | 33.6             |43.6*        |\n| InstructCodeT5+  | 35.0             |--           |\n| WizardLM-30B  1.0| 37.8             |--           |\n| WizardCoder-15B  1.0 | **57.3**     |**51.8**     |\n\n\n❗**Note: The reproduced result of StarCoder on MBPP.**\n\n❗**Note: The above table conducts a comprehensive comparison of our **WizardCoder** with other models on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks. We adhere to the approach outlined in previous studies by generating **20 samples** for each problem to estimate the pass@1 score and evaluate with the same [code](https://github.com/openai/human-eval/tree/master). The scores of GPT4 and GPT3.5 reported by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) are 67.0 and 48.1 (maybe these are the early version GPT4&3.5).**\n\n## Call for Feedbacks\nWe welcome everyone to use your professional and difficult instructions to evaluate WizardCoder, and show us examples of poor performance and your suggestions in the [issue discussion](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/issues) area. We are focusing on improving the Evol-Instruct now and hope to relieve existing weaknesses and issues in the the next version of WizardCoder. After that, we will open the code and pipeline of up-to-date Evol-Instruct algorithm and work with you together to improve it.\n\n\n## Contents\n\n1. [Online Demo](#online-demo)\n\n2. [Fine-tuning](#fine-tuning)\n\n3. [Inference](#inference)\n\n4. [Evaluation](#evaluation)\n\n5. [Citation](#citation)\n\n6. [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n\n## Online Demo\n\nWe will provide our latest models for you to try for as long as possible. If you find a link is not working, please try another one. At the same time, please try as many **real-world** and **challenging** code-related problems that you encounter in your work and life as possible. We will continue to evolve our models with your feedbacks.\n\n\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nWe fine-tune WizardCoder using the modified code `train.py` from [Llama-X](https://github.com/AetherCortex/Llama-X).\nWe fine-tune StarCoder-15B with the following hyperparameters:\n\n| Hyperparameter | StarCoder-15B |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| Batch size     | 512           |\n| Learning rate  | 2e-5          |\n| Epochs         | 3             |\n| Max length     | 2048          |\n| Warmup step    | 30            |\n| LR scheduler   | cosine        |\n\nTo reproduce our fine-tuning of WizardCoder, please follow the following steps:\n1. According to the instructions of [Llama-X](https://github.com/AetherCortex/Llama-X), install the environment, download the training code, and deploy. (Note: `deepspeed==0.9.2` and `transformers==4.29.2`)\n2. Replace the `train.py` with the `train_wizardcoder.py` in our repo (`src/train_wizardcoder.py`)\n3. Login Huggingface:\n```bash\nhuggingface-cli login\n```\n4. Execute the following training command:\n```bash\ndeepspeed train_wizardcoder.py \\n    --model_name_or_path "bigcode/starcoder" \\n    --data_path "/your/path/to/code_instruction_data.json" \\n    --output_dir "/your/path/to/ckpt" \\n    --num_train_epochs 3 \\n    --model_max_length 2048 \\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 16 \\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size 1 \\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \\n    --evaluation_strategy "no" \\n    --save_strategy "steps" \\n    --save_steps 50 \\n    --save_total_limit 2 \\n    --learning_rate 2e-5 \\n    --warmup_steps 30 \\n    --logging_steps 2 \\n    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \\n    --report_to "tensorboard" \\n    --gradient_checkpointing True \\n    --deepspeed configs/deepspeed_config.json \\n    --fp16 True\n```\n\n## Inference\n\nWe provide the decoding script for WizardCoder, which reads a input file and generates corresponding responses for each sample, and finally consolidates them into an output file.\n\nYou can specify `base_model`, `input_data_path` and `output_data_path` in `src\inference_wizardcoder.py` to set the decoding model, path of input file and path of output file.\n\n```bash\npip install jsonlines\n```\n\nThe decoding command is:\n```\npython src\inference_wizardcoder.py \\n    --base_model "/your/path/to/ckpt" \\n    --input_data_path "/your/path/to/input/data.jsonl" \\n    --output_data_path "/your/path/to/output/result.jsonl"\n```\n\nThe format of `data.jsonl` should be:\n```\n{"idx": 11, "Instruction": "Write a Python code to count 1 to 10."}\n{"idx": 12, "Instruction": "Write a Jave code to sum 1 to 10."}\n```\n\nThe prompt for our WizardCoder in `src\inference_wizardcoder.py` is:\n```\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Response:\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWe provide the evaluation script on HumanEval for WizardCoder.\n\n1.

To run the model, first \ninstall the latest version of the Diffusers library as well as `peft`, `accelerate` and `transformers`.\naudio dataset from the Hugging Face Hub:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade diffusers transformers accelerate peft\n```\n\n***Note: For detailed usage examples we recommend you to check out our official [LCM-LoRA docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/using-diffusers/inference_with_lcm_lora)***\n\n### Text-to-Image\n\nThe adapter can be loaded with it''s base model `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`. Next, the scheduler needs to be changed to [`LCMScheduler`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.22.3/en/api/schedulers/lcm#diffusers.LCMScheduler) and we can reduce the number of inference steps to just 2 to 8 steps.\nPlease make sure to either disable `guidance_scale` or use values between 1.0 and 2.0.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import LCMScheduler, AutoPipelineForText2Image\n\nmodel_id = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"\nadapter_id = "latent-consistency/lcm-lora-sdxl"\n\npipe = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16")\npipe.scheduler = LCMScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)\npipe.to("cuda")\n\n# load and fuse lcm lora\npipe.load_lora_weights(adapter_id)\npipe.fuse_lora()\n\nprompt = "Self-portrait oil painting, a beautiful cyborg with golden hair, 8k"\n\n# disable guidance_scale by passing 0\nimage = pipe(prompt=prompt, num_inference_steps=4, guidance_scale=0).images[0]\n```\n\n![](./image.png)\n\n### Inpainting\n\nLCM-LoRA can be used for inpainting as well. \n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForInpainting, LCMScheduler\nfrom diffusers.utils import load_image, make_image_grid\n\npipe = AutoPipelineForInpainting.from_pretrained(\n    "diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1",\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n    variant="fp16",\n).to("cuda")\n\n# set scheduler\npipe.scheduler = LCMScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)\n\n# load LCM-LoRA\npipe.load_lora_weights("latent-consistency/lcm-lora-sdxl")\npipe.fuse_lora()\n\n# load base and mask image\ninit_image = load_image("https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/inpaint.png").resize((1024, 1024))\nmask_image = load_image("https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/inpaint_mask.png").resize((1024, 1024))\n\nprompt = "a castle on top of a mountain, highly detailed, 8k"\ngenerator = torch.manual_seed(42)\nimage = pipe(\n    prompt=prompt,\n    image=init_image,\n    mask_image=mask_image,\n    generator=generator,\n    num_inference_steps=5,\n    guidance_scale=4,\n).images[0]\nmake_image_grid([init_image, mask_image, image], rows=1, cols=3)\n```\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/lcm/lcm_sdxl_inpainting.png)\n\n\n## Combine with styled LoRAs\n\nLCM-LoRA can be combined with other LoRAs to generate styled-images in very few steps (4-8). In the following example, we''ll use the LCM-LoRA with the [papercut LoRA](TheLastBen/Papercut_SDXL). \nTo learn more about how to combine LoRAs, refer to [this

Introduction\n\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\n\n**NOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the [Usage Recommendation](#usage-recommendations) section.**\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="80%" src="figures/benchmark.jpg">\n</p>\n\n## 2. Model Summary\n\n---\n\n**Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model**\n\n-  We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\n\n-   We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model''s reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\n    We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models. \n\n---\n\n**Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too**\n\n-  We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \n- Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\n## 3.

How to Run Locally\n\n### DeepSeek-R1 Models\n\nPlease visit [DeepSeek-V3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\n\n**NOTE: Hugging Face''s Transformers has not been directly supported yet.**\n\n### DeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\n\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm):\n\n```shell\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\n```\n\nYou can also easily start a service using [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)\n\n```bash\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n```\n\n### Usage Recommendations\n\n**We recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:**\n\n1. Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\n2. **Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.**\n3. For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."\n4. When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\n\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting "\<think\>\n\n\</think\>") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model''s performance.\n**To ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with "\<think\>\n" at the beginning of every output.**\n\n## 7.

Our text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task.\n\nT5-Base is the checkpoint with 220 million parameters. \n\n- **Developed by:** Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J.

We can even apply T5 to regression tasks by training it to predict the string representation of a number instead of the number itself.\n\nSee the [blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html) and [research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) for further details.\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\nMore information needed.\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nMore information needed.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nMore information needed.\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe model is pre-trained on the [Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4), which was developed and released in the context of the same [research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) as T5.\n\nThe model was pre-trained on a on a **multi-task mixture of unsupervised (1.) and supervised tasks (2.)**.\nThereby, the following datasets were being used for (1.) and (2.):\n\n1. **Datasets used for Unsupervised denoising objective**:\n\n- [C4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4)\n- [Wiki-DPR](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wiki_dpr)\n\n\n2. **Datasets used for Supervised text-to-text language modeling objective**\n\n- Sentence acceptability judgment\n  - CoLA [Warstadt et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12471)\n- Sentiment analysis \n  - SST-2 [Socher et al., 2013](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf)\n- Paraphrasing/sentence similarity\n  - MRPC [Dolan and Brockett, 2005](https://aclanthology.org/I05-5002)\n  - STS-B [Ceret al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00055)\n  - QQP [Iyer et al., 2017](https://quoradata.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs)\n- Natural language inference\n  - MNLI [Williams et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05426)\n  - QNLI [Rajpurkar et al.,2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)\n  - RTE [Dagan et al., 2005](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11736790_9) \n  - CB [De Marneff et al., 2019](https://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/Tg3ZGI2M/Marneffe.pdf)\n- Sentence completion\n  - COPA [Roemmele et al., 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221251392_Choice_of_Plausible_Alternatives_An_Evaluation_of_Commonsense_Causal_Reasoning)\n- Word sense disambiguation\n  - WIC [Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09121)\n- Question answering\n  - MultiRC [Khashabi et al., 2018](https://aclanthology.org/N18-1023)\n  - ReCoRD [Zhang et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12885)\n  - BoolQ [Clark et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10044)\n\n## Training Procedure\n\nIn their [abstract](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf), the model developers write: \n\n> In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. \n\nThe framework introduced, the T5 framework, involves a training procedure that brings together the approaches studied in the paper.

As real-world AI tasks grow\nincreasingly complex, VLMs must evolve beyond basic multimodal perception to enhance their reasoning capabilities in\ncomplex tasks. This involves improving accuracy, comprehensiveness, and intelligence, enabling applications such as\ncomplex problem solving, long-context understanding, and multimodal agents.\n\nBased on the [GLM-4-9B-0414](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-4) foundation model, we present the new open-source VLM model\n**GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking**, designed to explore the upper limits of reasoning in vision-language models. By introducing\na "thinking paradigm" and leveraging reinforcement learning, the model significantly enhances its capabilities. It\nachieves state-of-the-art performance among 10B-parameter VLMs, matching or even surpassing the 72B-parameter\nQwen-2.5-VL-72B on 18 benchmark tasks. We are also open-sourcing the base model GLM-4.1V-9B-Base to\nsupport further research into the boundaries of VLM capabilities.\n\n![rl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zai-org/GLM-4.1V-Thinking/refs/heads/main/resources/rl.jpeg)\n\nCompared to the previous generation models CogVLM2 and the GLM-4V series, **GLM-4.1V-Thinking** offers the\nfollowing improvements:\n\n1. The first reasoning-focused model in the series, achieving world-leading performance not only in mathematics but also\n   across various sub-domains.\n2. Supports **64k** context length.\n3. Handles **arbitrary aspect ratios** and up to **4K** image resolution.\n4. Provides an open-source version supporting both **Chinese and English bilingual** usage.\n\n## Benchmark Performance\n\nBy incorporating the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking significantly improves answer accuracy,\nrichness, and interpretability. It comprehensively surpasses traditional non-reasoning visual models.\nOut of 28 benchmark tasks, it achieved the best performance among 10B-level models on 23 tasks,\nand even outperformed the 72B-parameter Qwen-2.5-VL-72B on 18 tasks.\n\n![bench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zai-org/GLM-4.1V-Thinking/refs/heads/main/resources/bench.jpeg)\n\n## Quick Inference\n\nThis is a simple example of running single-image inference using the `transformers` library.  \nFirst, install the `transformers` library from source:\n\n```\npip install transformers>=4.57.1\n```\n\nThen, run the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, Glm4vForConditionalGeneration\nimport torch\n\nMODEL_PATH = "zai-org/GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking"\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {\n                "type": "image",\n                "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Grayscale_8bits_palette_sample_image.png"\n            },\n            {\n                "type": "text",\n                "text": "describe this image"\n            }\n        ],\n    }\n]\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH, use_fast=True)\nmodel = Glm4vForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\n    pretrained_model_name_or_path=MODEL_PATH,\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n    device_map="auto",\n)\ninputs = processor.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=True,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    return_dict=True,\n    return_tensors="pt"\n).to(model.device)\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=8192)\noutput_text = processor.decode(generated_ids[0][inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=False)\nprint(output_text)\n```\n\nFor video reasoning, web demo deployment, and more code, please check\nour [GitHub](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V).', '{"pipeline_tag":"image-text-to-text","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":10292777472,"storage_bytes":20605610600,"files_count":15,"spaces_count":29,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Glm4vForConditionalGeneration"],"model_type":"glm4v","tokenizer_config":{"eos_token":"<|endoftext|>","pad_token":"<|endoftext|>"},"chat_template_jinja":"[gMASK]<sop>\n{%- for msg in messages %}\n    {%- if msg.role == ''system'' %}\n<|system|>\n{{ msg.content }}\n    {%- elif msg.role == ''user'' %}\n<|user|>{{ ''\\n'' }}\n\n        {%- if msg.content is string %}\n{{ msg.content }}\n        {%- else %}\n            {%- for item in msg.content %}\n                {%- if item.type == ''video'' or ''video'' in item %}\n<|begin_of_video|><|video|><|end_of_video|>\n                {%- elif item.type == ''image'' or ''image'' in item %}\n<|begin_of_image|><|image|><|end_of_image|>\n                {%- elif item.type == ''text'' %}\n{{ item.text }}\n                {%- endif %}\n            {%- endfor %}\n        {%- endif %}\n    {%- elif msg.role == ''assistant'' %}\n        {%- if msg.metadata %}\n<|assistant|>{{ msg.metadata }}\n{{ msg.content }}\n        {%- else %}\n<|assistant|>\n{{ msg.content }}\n        {%- endif %}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endfor %}\n{% if add_generation_prompt %}<|assistant|>\n{% endif %}"}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:zai-org:GLM-4","source_url":"https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-4"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:zai-org:GLM-V","source_url":"https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2507.01006","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01006"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 63.8, '0ea38018b8e7114f7fd42a2e0dc26e77', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

This notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/PygmalionAI/gradio-ui/blob/master/notebooks/GPU.ipynb).\n\n### The manual way\n\nThe model can be used as a regular text generation model, but it''ll perform best if the input prompt adheres to the following format:\n\n```\n[CHARACTER]''s Persona: [A few sentences about the character you want the model to play]\n<START>\n[DIALOGUE HISTORY]\nYou: [Your input message here]\n[CHARACTER]:\n```\n\nWhere `[CHARACTER]` is, as you can probably guess, the name of the character you want the model to portray, `<START>` should be used verbatim as a delimiter token to separate persona and scenario data from the dialogue, and `[DIALOGUE HISTORY]` is chat history so the model can have some conversational context to draw from. Ideally it''ll be pairs of messages like:\n\n```\n[CHARACTER]: [some dialogue here]\nYou: [your response to the dialogue above]\n```\n\nApart from chat history, you can also just add example conversations in `[DIALOGUE HISTORY]` to show how the character should speak - ideally at the beginning, so it doesn''t get confused as to what''s conversation history vs. character definition.\n\n## Known issues\n\nWe haven''t played around with the model enough to enumerate them.

Our user studies demonstrate that our model outperforms SDXL, Playground v2, PixArt-α, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney 5.2.\n\nFor details on the development and training of our model, please refer to our [blog post](https://blog.playgroundai.com/playground-v2-5/) and [technical report](https://marketing-cdn.playground.com/research/pgv2.5_compressed.pdf).\n\n### Model Description\n- **Developed by:** [Playground](https://playground.com)\n- **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generative model\n- **License:** [Playground v2.5 Community License](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2.5-1024px-aesthetic/blob/main/LICENSE.md)\n- **Summary:** This model generates images based on text prompts. It is a Latent Diffusion Model that uses two fixed, pre-trained text encoders (OpenCLIP-ViT/G and CLIP-ViT/L). It follows the same architecture as [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/using-diffusers/sdxl).\n\n### Using the model with 🧨 Diffusers\n\nInstall diffusers >= 0.27.0 and the relevant dependencies.\n\n```\npip install diffusers>=0.27.0\npip install transformers accelerate safetensors\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- The pipeline uses the `EDMDPMSolverMultistepScheduler` scheduler by default, for crisper fine details. It''s an [EDM formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364) of the DPM++ 2M Karras scheduler. `guidance_scale=3.0` is a good default for this scheduler.\n- The pipeline also supports the `EDMEulerScheduler` scheduler. It''s an [EDM formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364) of the Euler scheduler. `guidance_scale=5.0` is a good default for this scheduler.\n\nThen, run the following snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\nimport torch\n\npipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    "playgroundai/playground-v2.5-1024px-aesthetic",\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n    variant="fp16",\n).to("cuda")\n\n# # Optional: Use DPM++ 2M Karras scheduler for crisper fine details\n# from diffusers import EDMDPMSolverMultistepScheduler\n# pipe.scheduler = EDMDPMSolverMultistepScheduler()\n\nprompt = "Astronaut in a jungle, cold color palette, muted colors, detailed, 8k"\nimage = pipe(prompt=prompt, num_inference_steps=50, guidance_scale=3).images[0]\n```\n\n### Using the model with Automatic1111/ComfyUI\n\nSupport coming soon. We will update this model card with instructions when ready.\n\n### User Studies\n\nThis model card only provides a brief summary of our user study results. For extensive details on how we perform user studies, please check out our [technical report](https://marketing-cdn.playground.com/research/pgv2.5_compressed.pdf).\n\nWe conducted studies to measure overall aesthetic quality, as well as for the specific areas we aimed to improve with Playground v2.5, namely multi aspect ratios and human preference alignment.\n\n#### Comparison to State-of-the-Art\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63855d851769b7c4b10e1f76/V7LFNzgoQJnL__ndU0CnE.png)\n\nThe aesthetic quality of Playground v2.5 dramatically outperforms the current state-of-the-art open source models SDXL and PIXART-α, as well as Playground v2. Because the performance differential between Playground V2.5 and SDXL was so large, we also tested our aesthetic quality against world-class closed-source models like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney 5.2, and found that Playground v2.5 outperforms them as well.\n\n#### Multi Aspect Ratios\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/636c0c4eaae2da3c76b8a9a3/xMB0r-CmR3N6dABFlcV71.png)\n\nSimilarly, for multi aspect ratios, we outperform SDXL by a large margin.\n\n#### Human Preference Alignment on People-related images\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/636c0c4eaae2da3c76b8a9a3/7c-8Stw52OsNtUjse8Slv.png)\n\nNext, we benchmark Playground v2.5 specifically on people-related images, to test Human Preference Alignment. We compared Playground v2.5 against two commonly-used baseline models: SDXL and RealStock v2, a community fine-tune of SDXL that was trained on a realistic people dataset.\n\nPlayground v2.5 outperforms both baselines by a large margin.\n\n### MJHQ-30K Benchmark\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/636c0c4eaae2da3c76b8a9a3/7tyYDPGUtokh-k18XDSte.png)\n\n| Model                                 | Overall FID   |\n| ------------------------------------- | ----- |\n| SDXL-1-0-refiner                      | 9.55  |\n| [playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic)        | 7.07  |\n| [playground-v2.5-1024px-aesthetic](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2.5-1024px-aesthetic) | **4.48** |\n\nLastly, we report metrics using our MJHQ-30K benchmark which we [open-sourced](https://huggingface.co/datasets/playgroundai/MJHQ-30K) with the v2 release. We report both the overall FID and per category FID. All FID metrics are computed at resolution 1024x1024. Our results show that Playground v2.5 outperforms both Playground v2 and SDXL in overall FID and all category FIDs, especially in the people and fashion categories. This is in line with the results of the user study, which indicates a correlation between human preferences and the FID score of the MJHQ-30K benchmark.\n\n### How to cite us\n\n```\n@misc{li2024playground,\n      title={Playground v2.5: Three Insights towards Enhancing Aesthetic Quality in Text-to-Image Generation}, \n      author={Daiqing Li and Aleks Kamko and Ehsan Akhgari and Ali Sabet and Linmiao Xu and Suhail Doshi},\n      year={2024},\n      eprint={2402.17245},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CV}\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-to-image","library_name":"diffusers","framework":"diffusers","params":null,"storage_bytes":62442642030,"files_count":35,"spaces_count":84,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"diffusers":{"_class_name":"StableDiffusionXLPipeline"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2206.00364","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2402.17245","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17245"}]', NULL, 'Other', 'approved', 63.8, '6fe8313c2c1b3f19714e97e6239175f3', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

The process can also extend to text-to-3D generation by first generating a single image using SDXL and then using SDS on Stable Zero123 to generate the 3D object.\n\nTo enable open research in 3D object generation, we''ve improved the open-source code of threestudio by supporting Zero123 and Stable Zero123.\nTo use Stable Zero123 for object 3D mesh generation in [threestudio](https://github.com/threestudio-project/threestudio#stable-zero123), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install threestudio using their [instructions](https://github.com/threestudio-project/threestudio#installation)\n2. Download the Stable Zero123 checkpoint `stable_zero123.ckpt` into the `load/zero123/` directory\n2. Take an image of your choice, or generate it from text using your favourite AI image generator such as Stable Assistant (https://stability.ai/stable-assistant) E.g. "A simple 3D render of a friendly dog"\n3. Remove its background using Stable Assistant (https://stability.ai/stable-assistant)\n4. Save to `load/images/`, preferably with `_rgba.png` as the suffix\n5. Run Zero-1-to-3 with the Stable Zero123 ckpt:\n```sh\npython launch.py --config configs/stable-zero123.yaml --train --gpu 0 data.image_path=./load/images/hamburger_rgba.png\n```\n\n## Model Details\n\n* **Developed by**: [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/)\n* **Model type**: latent diffusion model.\n* **Finetuned from model**: [lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers)\n* **License**: We released 2 versions of Stable Zero123.\n    * **Stable Zero123** included some CC-BY-NC 3D objects, so it cannot be used commercially, but can be used for research purposes. It is released under the [Stability AI Non-Commercial Research Community License](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/zero123-sai/raw/main/LICENSE_stable_zero123.md).\n    * **Stable Zero123C** (“C” for “Commercially-available”) was only trained on CC-BY and CC0 3D objects. It is released under [StabilityAI Community License](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/zero123-sai/raw/main/LICENSE_stable_zero123_c.md). You can read more about the license [here](https://stability.ai/license). \nAccording to our internal tests, both models perform similarly in terms of prediction visual quality.\n\n### Training Dataset\n\nWe use renders from the [Objaverse](https://objaverse.allenai.org/objaverse-1.0) dataset, utilizing our enhanced rendering method\n\n### Training Infrastructure\n\n* **Hardware**: `Stable Zero123` was trained on the Stability AI cluster on a single node with 8 A100 80GBs GPUs.\n* **Code Base**: We use our modified version of [the original zero123 repository](https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/zero123).\n\n\n### Misuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-to-3d","library_name":null,"framework":null,"params":null,"storage_bytes":34336215865,"files_count":7,"spaces_count":2,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":null}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:cvlab-columbia:zero123","source_url":"https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/zero123"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:threestudio-project:threestudio","source_url":"https://github.com/threestudio-project/threestudio#stable-zero123"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:threestudio-project:threestudio","source_url":"https://github.com/threestudio-project/threestudio#installation"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:cvlab-columbia:zero123","source_url":"https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/zero123"}]', NULL, 'Other', 'approved', 63.8, '5a324e441553ebbc78b6936436a82901', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
