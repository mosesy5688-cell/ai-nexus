Building on the Pi0.5 architecture, we introduce several innovations. Our primary contribution is correlated noise for flow matching, which improves training efficiency and enables correlation-aware inpainting for smooth action sequences. We also apply learnable mixed-layer attention and System 2 stage tracking for ambiguity resolution. Training employs multi-sample flow matching to reduce variance, while inference uses action compression and challenge-specific correction rules. Our approach achieves 26% q-score across all 50 tasks on both public and private leaderboards.",

We introduce \\textbf{PARIS} (Pruning Algorithm via the Representer theorem for Imbalanced Scenarios), a principled framework that mitigates imbalance by \\emph{optimizing the training set itself}. PARIS leverages the representer theorem for neural networks to compute a \\textbf{closed-form representer deletion residual}, which quantifies the exact change in validation loss caused by removing a single training point \\emph{without retraining}. Combined with an efficient Cholesky rank-one downdating scheme, PARIS performs fast, iterative pruning that eliminates uninformative or performance-degrading samples. We use a real-world space weather example, where PARIS reduces the training set by up to 75\\% while preserving or improving overall RMSE, outperforming re-weighting, synthetic oversampling, and boosting baselines. Our results demonstrate that representer-guided dataset pruning is a powerful, interpretable, and computationally efficient approach to rare-event regression.",

Current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches operate primarily on visual texture, often treating tissues as independent regions and failing to encode biological context. To this end, we introduce Neural Tissue Relation Modeling (NTRM), a novel segmentation framework that augments CNNs with a tissue-level graph neural network to model spatial and functional relationships across tissue types. NTRM constructs a graph over predicted regions, propagates contextual information via message passing, and refines segmentation through spatial projection. Unlike prior methods, NTRM explicitly encodes inter-tissue dependencies, enabling structurally coherent predictions in boundary-dense zones. On the benchmark Histopathology Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Segmentation Dataset, NTRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a robust Dice similarity coefficient that is 4.9\\% to 31.25\\% higher than the best-performing models among the evaluated approaches. Our experiments indicate that relational modeling offers a principled path toward more context-aware and interpretable histological segmentation, compared to local receptive-field architectures that lack tissue-level structural awareness.

Aggregating their predictive uncertainties to produce reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification is therefore a critical but still underexplored challenge, especially within the framework of conformal prediction (CP). While CP methods can generate individual prediction sets from each model, combining them into a single, more informative set remains a challenging problem. To address this, we propose SACP (Symmetric Aggregated Conformal Prediction), a novel method that aggregates nonconformity scores from multiple predictors. SACP transforms these scores into e-values and combines them using any symmetric aggregation function. This flexible design enables a robust, data-driven framework for selecting aggregation strategies that yield sharper prediction sets. We also provide theoretical insights that help justify the validity and performance of the SACP approach. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show that SACP consistently improves efficiency and often outperforms state-of-the-art model aggregation baselines.",
