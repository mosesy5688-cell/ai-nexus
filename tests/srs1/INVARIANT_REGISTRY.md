# SRS-1 — Invariant Suite Central Registry (Tier-1, BLOCKING)

> **What this is.** SRS-1 is the consolidated, **hermetic**, **deterministic**
> invariant suite for Free2AITools. It is a permanent **BLOCKING PR gate**
> (Tier-1). This file is the **central registry**: a single map from each
> `gap/invariant ID -> assertion file -> protected behavior -> evidence class`.
> It is NOT a re-copy of the per-fix tests — it **references** the regression
> tests that already exist (so their logic is not duplicated) and adds hermetic
> tests only for invariants that were not yet covered.

## Tiering

| Tier | Suite | Trigger | Blocking? |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Tier-1 (this suite)** | SRS-1 hermetic invariant suite (all `tests/unit/*.test.ts` + `tests/srs1/*.test.ts`) | `pull_request` -> `unit-test` job in `.github/workflows/test-suite.yml` (`npx vitest run`) | **YES — required, blocks merge** |
| Tier-2 | SRS-2A frontend Playwright baseline (`tests/e2e/srs2a-frontend-baseline.spec.ts`) | post-deploy `workflow_run` + daily cron | NO — informational, `continue-on-error: true`, never a PR check |

**Hermetic boundary (Founder, hard):** no live network, no production dependency,
no duplicated product LOGIC (every assertion reads repo SOURCE/CONFIG @ `main`,
never re-implements the behavior), no screenshot-only assertion, no
timing-sensitive assertion. Run 3+ times -> identical results (see determinism
proof in the PR body).

## Evidence classes

- **SOURCE** — asserts on the literal source of a route/handler/page/util.
- **CONFIG** — asserts on a static config artifact (OpenAPI JSON, mcp.json, sitemap, `_redirects`, llms template).
- **EXEC** — executes the real shared module with a mock seam (no network) and asserts behavior.
- **STRUCT** — asserts a filesystem-routing structural fact (route file present/absent ⇒ reachable/404/410).

## P-09 — added at post-P-09 rebase (merge order: P-09 -> SRS-1)

- **P-09 redirect-authority end-state** was intentionally deferred out of the
  initial SRS-1 PR because it changed during the P-09 cleanup PR (merged to main
  as `e2f46911`). PM merge order **P-09 -> SRS-1** was honored: SRS-1 was rebased
  onto post-P-09 main and the redirect-authority invariant
  (`tests/srs1/redirect-authority.test.ts`, row P-09 above) added then. It pins
  the *authority shape* (adapter `redirects:` map + SSR pages are live; the dead
  `public/_redirects` FILE is deleted), complementing the per-fix regression guard
  `tests/unit/redirect-authority-cleanup.test.ts` (logic not duplicated).

## Reused vs newly added — summary

- **REUSED (referenced, logic not duplicated): 14 invariants** — G-01, G-03, G-04,
  G-05, G-06, G-07, G-08, P-01, P-02, P-03, P-04, P-05, P-06, P-07 (their
  per-fix tests under `tests/unit/` remain the source of truth; SRS-1 points at
  them and, where useful, adds a thin cross-tier re-lock).
- **NEW hermetic tests added (gaps not previously covered): 9 invariants** — P-08,
  P-09, MCP-SET, NEG-MCP, NEG-RANK, NEG-DOCS, OAS-PARITY, OAS-CAPS, RETIRE-SITEMAP,
  RETIRE-410 — in 5 files under `tests/srs1/`.

## How SRS-1 is wired as the blocking gate

The Tier-1 suite runs through the **existing required `unit-test` job** in
`.github/workflows/test-suite.yml`, which executes `npx vitest run` on every
`pull_request` to `main`. `vitest.config.ts` includes `**/*.{test,spec}.ts`, so
both `tests/unit/*` (reused) and the new `tests/srs1/*` files are collected
automatically — no separate runner. A red SRS-1 assertion fails `unit-test`,
which blocks the merge. SRS-2A (Tier-2) is a separate, non-blocking,
post-deploy workflow and is never a PR check.
