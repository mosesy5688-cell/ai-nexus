I''ve been building native mobile applications (Android/iOS/Blackberry) since 2011. I have a Software Engineering degree, not a Computer Science degree. I have an itty-bitty amount of basic knowledge about: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Probability & Statistics from university.\nThink about my interest in machine learning:\n- [Can I learn and get a job in Machine Learning without studying CS Master and PhD?](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-and-get-a-job-in-Machine-Learning-without-studying-CS-Master-and-PhD)\n    - *"You can, but it is far more difficult than when I got into the field."* [Drac Smith](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-and-get-a-job-in-Machine-Learning-without-studying-CS-Master-and-PhD/answer/Drac-Smith?srid=oT0p)\n- [How do I get a job in Machine Learning as a software programmer who self-studies Machine Learning, but  never has a chance to use it at work?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-a-job-in-Machine-Learning-as-a-software-programmer-who-self-studies-Machine-Learning-but-never-has-a-chance-to-use-it-at-work)\n    - *"I''m hiring machine learning experts for my team and your MOOC will not get you the job (there is better news below).

It’s the mess of reality.\n- Theoretical Machine Learning: This is about math and abstraction and idealized scenarios and limits and beauty and informing what is possible. It is a whole lot neater and cleaner and removed from the mess of reality.\n\nI think the best way for practice-focused methodology is something like [''practice — learning — practice''](http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-for-programmers/#comment-358985), that means where students first come with some existing projects with problems and solutions (practice) to get familiar with traditional methods in the area and perhaps also with their methodology. After practicing with some elementary experiences, they can go into the books and study the underlying theory, which serves to guide their future advanced practice and will enhance their toolbox of solving practical problems. Studying theory also further improves their understanding on the elementary experiences, and will help them acquire advanced experiences more quickly.\n\n It''s a long plan. It''s going to take me years. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.\n\n## How to use it\nEverything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.\n\nI''m using Github''s special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.\n\n- [x] Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]\n\n[More about Github-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)\n\n## Follow me\nI''m a Vietnamese Software Engineer who is really passionate and wants to work in the USA.\n\nHow much did I work during this plan?

On the pytorch website, be sure to select the right CUDA version you have. If you intend to run on CPU mode only, select `CUDA = None`.\n\nNote 2: We also provide a Dockerfile [here](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/blob/master/Dockerfile).\n\n## Usage\n\n``` python\nimport easyocr\nreader = easyocr.Reader([''ch_sim'',''en'']) # this needs to run only once to load the model into memory\nresult = reader.readtext(''chinese.jpg'')\n```\n\nThe output will be in a list format, each item represents a bounding box, the text detected and confident level, respectively.\n\n``` bash\n[([[189, 75], [469, 75], [469, 165], [189, 165]], ''愚园路'', 0.3754989504814148),\n ([[86, 80], [134, 80], [134, 128], [86, 128]], ''西'', 0.40452659130096436),\n ([[517, 81], [565, 81], [565, 123], [517, 123]], ''东'', 0.9989598989486694),\n ([[78, 126], [136, 126], [136, 156], [78, 156]], ''315'', 0.8125889301300049),\n ([[514, 126], [574, 126], [574, 156], [514, 156]], ''309'', 0.4971577227115631),\n ([[226, 170], [414, 170], [414, 220], [226, 220]], ''Yuyuan Rd.'', 0.8261902332305908),\n ([[79, 173], [125, 173], [125, 213], [79, 213]], ''W'', 0.9848111271858215),\n ([[529, 173], [569, 173], [569, 213], [529, 213]], ''E'', 0.8405593633651733)]\n```\nNote 1: `[''ch_sim'',''en'']` is the list of languages you want to read. You can pass\nseveral languages at once but not all languages can be used together.\nEnglish is compatible with every language and languages that share common characters are usually compatible with each other.\n\nNote 2: Instead of the filepath `chinese.jpg`, you can also pass an OpenCV image object (numpy array) or an image file as bytes. A URL to a raw image is also acceptable.\n\nNote 3: The line `reader = easyocr.Reader([''ch_sim'',''en''])` is for loading a model into memory. It takes some time but it needs to be run only once.\n\nYou can also set `detail=0` for simpler output.\n\n``` python\nreader.readtext(''chinese.jpg'', detail = 0)\n```\nResult:\n``` bash\n[''愚园路'', ''西'', ''东'', ''315'', ''309'', ''Yuyuan Rd.'', ''W'', ''E'']\n```\n\nModel weights for the chosen language will be automatically downloaded or you can\ndownload them manually from the [model hub](https://www.jaided.ai/easyocr/modelhub) and put them in the ''~/.EasyOCR/model'' folder\n\nIn case you do not have a GPU, or your GPU has low memory, you can run the model in CPU-only mode by adding `gpu=False`.\n\n``` python\nreader = easyocr.Reader([''ch_sim'',''en''], gpu=False)\n```\n\nFor more information, read the [tutorial](https://www.jaided.ai/easyocr/tutorial) and [API Documentation](https://www.jaided.ai/easyocr/documentation).\n\n#### Run on command line\n\n```shell\n$ easyocr -l ch_sim en -f chinese.jpg --detail=1 --gpu=True\n```\n\n## Train/use your own model\n\nFor recognition model, [Read here](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/blob/master/custom_model.md).\n\nFor detection model (CRAFT), [Read here](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/blob/master/trainer/craft/README.md).\n\n## Implementation Roadmap\n\n- Handwritten support\n- Restructure code to support swappable detection and recognition algorithms\nThe api should be as easy as\n``` python\nreader = easyocr.Reader([''en''], detection=''DB'', recognition = ''Transformer'')\n```\nThe idea is to be able to plug in any state-of-the-art model into EasyOCR. There are a lot of geniuses trying to make better detection/recognition models, but we are not trying to be geniuses here. We just want to make their works quickly accessible to the public ... for free. (well, we believe most geniuses want their work to create a positive impact as fast/big as possible) The pipeline should be something like the below diagram. Grey slots are placeholders for changeable light blue modules.\n\n![plan](examples/easyocr_framework.jpeg)\n\n## Acknowledgement and References\n\nThis project is based on research and code from several papers and open-source repositories.\n\nAll deep learning execution is based on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org). :heart:\n\nDetection execution uses the CRAFT algorithm from this [official repository](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch) and their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01941) (Thanks @YoungminBaek from [@clovaai](https://github.com/clovaai)). We also use their pretrained model. Training script is provided by [@gmuffiness](https://github.com/gmuffiness).\n\nThe recognition model is a CRNN ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05717)). It is composed of 3 main components: feature extraction (we are currently using [Resnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)) and VGG, sequence labeling ([LSTM](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf)) and decoding ([CTC](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf)). The training pipeline for recognition execution is a modified version of the [deep-text-recognition-benchmark](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark) framework. (Thanks [@ku21fan](https://github.com/ku21fan) from [@clovaai](https://github.com/clovaai)) This repository is a gem that deserves more recognition.\n\nBeam search code is based on this [repository](https://github.com/githubharald/CTCDecoder) and his [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/beam-search-decoding-in-ctc-trained-neural-networks-5a889a3d85a7). (Thanks [@githubharald](https://github.com/githubharald))\n\nData synthesis is based on [TextRecognitionDataGenerator](https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator). (Thanks [@Belval](https://github.com/Belval))\n\nAnd a good read about CTC from distill.pub [here](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/).\n\n## Want To Contribute?\n\nLet''s advance humanity together by making AI available to everyone!\n\n3 ways to contribute:\n\n**Coder:** Please send a PR for small bugs/improvements. For bigger ones, discuss with us by opening an issue first. There is a list of possible bug/improvement issues tagged with [''PR WELCOME''](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22PR+WELCOME%22).\n\n**User:** Tell us how EasyOCR benefits you/your organization to encourage further development. Also post failure cases in [Issue  Section](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/issues) to help improve future models.\n\n**Tech leader/Guru:** If you found this library useful, please spread the word! (See [Yann Lecun''s post](https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10157018122787143) about EasyOCR)\n\n## Guideline for new language request\n\nTo request a new language, we need you to send a PR with the 2 following files:\n\n1. In folder [easyocr/character](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/tree/master/easyocr/character),\nwe need ''yourlanguagecode_char.txt'' that contains list of all characters. Please see format examples from other files in that folder.\n2. In folder [easyocr/dict](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/tree/master/easyocr/dict),\nwe need ''yourlanguagecode.txt'' that contains list of words in your language.\nOn average, we have ~30000 words per language with more than 50000 words for more popular ones.\nMore is better in this file.\n\nIf your language has unique elements (such as 1. Arabic: characters change form when attached to each other + write from right to left 2. Thai: Some characters need to be above the line and some below), please educate us to the best of your ability and/or give useful links. It is important to take care of the detail to achieve a system that really works.\n\nLastly, please understand that our priority will have to go to popular languages or sets of languages that share large portions of their characters with each other (also tell us if this is the case for your language). It takes us at least a week to develop a new model, so you may have to wait a while for the new model to be released.\n\nSee [List of languages in development](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/issues/91)\n\n## Github Issues\n\nDue to limited resources, an issue older than 6 months will be automatically closed. Please open an issue again if it is critical.\n\n## Business Inquiries\n\nFor Enterprise Support, [Jaided AI](https://www.jaided.ai/) offers full service for custom OCR/AI systems from implementation, training/finetuning and deployment.

In those days people with backgrounds in physics and math streamed to investment banks and hedge funds, where they could devise entirely new algorithms and data strategies. Then a variety of universities developed master’s programs in financial engineering, which churned out a second generation of talent that was more accessible to mainstream firms. The pattern was repeated later in the 1990s with search engineers, whose rarefied skills soon came to be taught in computer science programs._ |\n| [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) | _Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.

With businesses increasingly relying on data to make decisions, the need for skilled data scientists has grown rapidly. Whether it’s tech companies, healthcare organizations, or even government institutions, data scientists play a crucial role in turning raw data into valuable insights. But how do you become a data scientist, especially if you’re just starting out? _|\n\n## Where do I Start?\n**[`^        back to top        ^`](#awesome-data-science)**\n\nWhile not strictly necessary, having a programming language is a crucial skill to be effective as a data scientist. Currently, the most popular language is _Python_, closely followed by _R_. Python is a general-purpose scripting language that sees applications in a wide variety of fields. R is a domain-specific language for statistics, which contains a lot of common statistics tools out of the box.\n\n[Python](https://python.org/) is by far the most popular language in science, due in no small part to the ease at which it can be used and the vibrant ecosystem of user-generated packages. To install packages, there are two main methods: Pip (invoked as `pip install`), the package manager that comes bundled with Python, and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) (invoked as `conda install`), a powerful package manager that can install packages for Python, R, and can download executables like Git. \n\nUnlike R, Python was not built from the ground up with data science in mind, but there are plenty of third party libraries to make up for this. A much more exhaustive list of packages can be found later in this document, but these four packages are a good set of choices to start your data science journey with: [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is a general-purpose data science package which implements the most popular algorithms - it also includes rich documentation, tutorials, and examples of the models it implements. Even if you prefer to write your own implementations, Scikit-Learn is a valuable reference to the nuts-and-bolts behind many of the common algorithms you''ll find. With [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), one can collect and analyze their data into a convenient table format. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) provides very fast tooling for mathematical operations, with a focus on vectors and matrices. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), itself based on the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) package, is a quick way to generate beautiful visualizations of your data, with many good defaults available out of the box, as well as a gallery showing how to produce many common visualizations of your data.\n\n When embarking on your journey to becoming a data scientist, the choice of language isn''t particularly important, and both Python and R have their pros and cons. Pick a language you like, and check out one of the [Free courses](#free-courses) we''ve listed below!\n\n## Agents\n\nPlease, contribute about "agents"\n\n### Workflow  \n**[`^        back to top        ^`](#awesome-data-science)**\n- [sim](https://sim.ai) Sim Studio''s interface is a lightweight, intuitive way to quickly build and deploy LLMs that connect with your favorite tools.\n\n\n## Training Resources\n**[`^        back to top        ^`](#awesome-data-science)**\n\nHow do you learn data science?

See the fast.ai documentation on\n[Using Colab](https://course19.fast.ai/start_colab.html) for more information.\n\nYou can install fastai on your own machines with: `pip install fastai`.\n\nIf you plan to develop fastai yourself, or want to be on the cutting\nedge, you can use an editable install (if you do this, you should also\nuse an editable install of\n[fastcore](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore) to go with it.) First\ninstall PyTorch, and then:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai\n    pip install -e "fastai[dev]"\n\n## Learning fastai\n\nThe best way to get started with fastai (and deep learning) is to read\n[the\nbook](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527),\nand complete [the free course](https://course.fast.ai).\n\nTo see what’s possible with fastai, take a look at the [Quick\nStart](https://docs.fast.ai/quick_start.html), which shows how to use\naround 5 lines of code to build an image classifier, an image\nsegmentation model, a text sentiment model, a recommendation system, and\na tabular model. For each of the applications, the code is much the\nsame.\n\nRead through the [Tutorials](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.html) to\nlearn how to train your own models on your own datasets. Use the\nnavigation sidebar to look through the fastai documentation. Every\nclass, function, and method is documented here.\n\nTo learn about the design and motivation of the library, read the [peer\nreviewed paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/2/108/htm).\n\n## About fastai\n\nfastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with\nhigh-level components that can quickly and easily provide\nstate-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides\nresearchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to\nbuild new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial\ncompromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is\npossible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses\ncommon underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing\ntechniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be\nexpressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the\nunderlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library.\nfastai includes:\n\n- A new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type\n  hierarchy for tensors\n- A GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure\n  Python\n- An optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern\n  optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to\n  be implemented in 4–5 lines of code\n- A novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data,\n  model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training\n- A new data block API\n- And much more…\n\nfastai is organized around two main design goals: to be approachable and\nrapidly productive, while also being deeply hackable and configurable.\nIt is built on top of a hierarchy of lower-level APIs which provide\ncomposable building blocks. This way, a user wanting to rewrite part of\nthe high-level API or add particular behavior to suit their needs does\nnot have to learn how to use the lowest level.\n\n<img alt="Layered API" src="images/layered.png" width="345">\n\n## Migrating from other libraries\n\nIt’s very easy to migrate from plain PyTorch, Ignite, or any other\nPyTorch-based library, or even to use fastai in conjunction with other\nlibraries. Generally, you’ll be able to use all your existing data\nprocessing code, but will be able to reduce the amount of code you\nrequire for training, and more easily take advantage of modern best\npractices. Here are migration guides from some popular libraries to help\nyou on your way:\n\n- [Plain PyTorch](https://docs.fast.ai/examples/migrating_pytorch.html)\n- [Ignite](https://docs.fast.ai/examples/migrating_ignite.html)\n- [Lightning](https://docs.fast.ai/examples/migrating_lightning.html)\n- [Catalyst](https://docs.fast.ai/examples/migrating_catalyst.html)\n\n## Windows Support\n\nDue to python multiprocessing issues on Jupyter and Windows,\n`num_workers` of `Dataloader` is reset to 0 automatically to avoid\nJupyter hanging. This makes tasks such as computer vision in Jupyter on\nWindows many times slower than on Linux. This limitation doesn’t exist\nif you use fastai from a script.\n\nSee [this\nexample](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/nbs/examples/dataloader_spawn.py)\nto fully leverage the fastai API on Windows.\n\nWe recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instead – if you do\nthat, you can use the regular Linux installation approach, and you won’t\nhave any issues with `num_workers`.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests in parallel, launch:\n\n`nbdev_test`\n\nFor all the tests to pass, you’ll need to install the dependencies\nspecified as part of dev_requirements in settings.ini\n\n`pip install -e .[dev]`\n\nTests are written using `nbdev`, for example see the documentation for\n`test_eq`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAfter you clone this repository, make sure you have run\n`nbdev_install_hooks` in your terminal. This install Jupyter and git\nhooks to automatically clean, trust, and fix merge conflicts in\nnotebooks.\n\nAfter making changes in the repo, you should run `nbdev_prepare` and\nmake additional and necessary changes in order to pass all the tests.\n\n## Docker Containers\n\nFor those interested in official docker containers for this project,\nthey can be found\n[here](https://github.com/fastai/docker-containers#fastai).\n', '{"language":"Jupyter Notebook","stars":27645,"forks":7664,"watchers":27645,"open_issues":267,"topics":["colab","deep-learning","fastai","gpu","machine-learning","notebooks","python","pytorch"],"default_branch":"main","size_kb":825037,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:fastai:fastai","source_url":"https://github.com/fastai/fastai"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:fastai:fastai","source_url":"https://github.com/fastai/fastai"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:fastai:fastai","source_url":"https://github.com/fastai/fastai"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:fastai:fastcore","source_url":"https://github.com/fastai/fastcore"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:fastai:fastai","source_url":"https://github.com/fastai/fastai"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:fastai:fastai","source_url":"https://github.com/fastai/fastai"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:fastai:docker-containers","source_url":"https://github.com/fastai/docker-containers#fastai"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 65, '932f425ca29f00225fdf219ecfd25988', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Using Docker is highly recommended.\n\n### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)\n\nPerplexica can be easily run using Docker. Simply run the following command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v perplexica-data:/home/perplexica/data -v perplexica-uploads:/home/perplexica/uploads --name perplexica itzcrazykns1337/perplexica:latest\n```\n\nThis will pull and start the Perplexica container with the bundled SearxNG search engine. Once running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You can then configure your settings (API keys, models, etc.) directly in the setup screen.\n\n**Note**: The image includes both Perplexica and SearxNG, so no additional setup is required. The `-v` flags create persistent volumes for your data and uploaded files.\n\n#### Using Perplexica with Your Own SearxNG Instance\n\nIf you already have SearxNG running, you can use the slim version of Perplexica:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e SEARXNG_API_URL=http://your-searxng-url:8080 -v perplexica-data:/home/perplexica/data -v perplexica-uploads:/home/perplexica/uploads --name perplexica itzcrazykns1337/perplexica:slim-latest\n```\n\n**Important**: Make sure your SearxNG instance has:\n\n- JSON format enabled in the settings\n- Wolfram Alpha search engine enabled\n\nReplace `http://your-searxng-url:8080` with your actual SearxNG URL. Then configure your AI provider settings in the setup screen at http://localhost:3000.\n\n#### Advanced Setup (Building from Source)\n\nIf you prefer to build from source or need more control:\n\n1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.\n2. Clone the Perplexica repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git\n   ```\n\n3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.\n\n4. Build and run using Docker:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t perplexica .\n   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v perplexica-data:/home/perplexica/data -v perplexica-uploads:/home/perplexica/uploads --name perplexica perplexica\n   ```\n\n5. Access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 and configure your settings in the setup screen.\n\n**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.\n\n### Non-Docker Installation\n\n1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings. Make sure Wolfram Alpha search engine is also enabled.\n2. Clone the repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git\n   cd Perplexica\n   ```\n\n3. Install dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm i\n   ```\n\n4. Build the application:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n5. Start the application:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run start\n   ```\n\n6. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to complete the setup and configure your settings (API keys, models, SearxNG URL, etc.) in the setup screen.\n\n**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.\n\nSee the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like updating, etc.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Local OpenAI-API-Compliant Servers\n\nIf Perplexica tells you that you haven''t configured any chat model providers, ensure that:\n\n1. Your server is running on `0.0.0.0` (not `127.0.0.1`) and on the same port you put in the API URL.\n2. You have specified the correct model name loaded by your local LLM server.\n3. You have specified the correct API key, or if one is not defined, you have put _something_ in the API key field and not left it empty.\n\n#### Ollama Connection Errors\n\nIf you''re encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama''s API. To fix this issue you can:\n\n1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.\n2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**\n\n   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`\n   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`\n   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:11434`\n\n   Adjust the port number if you''re using a different one.\n\n3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**\n\n   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"`. (Change the port number if you are using a different one.) Then reload the systemd manager configuration with `systemctl daemon-reload`, and restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)\n\n   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.\n\n#### Lemonade Connection Errors\n\nIf you''re encountering a Lemonade connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Lemonade''s API. To fix this issue you can:\n\n1. **Check your Lemonade API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.\n2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**\n\n   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:8000`\n   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:8000`\n   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:8000`\n\n   Adjust the port number if you''re using a different one.\n\n3. **Ensure Lemonade Server is Running:**\n\n   - Make sure your Lemonade server is running and accessible on the configured port (default is 8000).\n   - Verify that Lemonade is configured to accept connections from all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), not just localhost (`127.0.0.1`).\n   - Ensure that the port (default is 8000) is not blocked by your firewall.\n\n## Using as a Search Engine\n\nIf you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser''s search bar, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your browser''s settings.\n2. Navigate to the ''Search Engines'' section.\n3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.\n4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser''s search bar.\n\n## Using Perplexica''s API\n\nPerplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.\n\nFor more details, check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md).\n\n## Expose Perplexica to network\n\nPerplexica runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.\n\n## One-Click Deployment\n\n[![Deploy to Sealos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labring-actions/templates/main/Deploy-on-Sealos.svg)](https://usw.sealos.io/?openapp=system-template%3FtemplateName%3Dperplexica)\n[![Deploy to RepoCloud](https://d16t0pc4846x52.cloudfront.net/deploylobe.svg)](https://repocloud.io/details/?app_id=267)\n[![Run on ClawCloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClawCloud/Run-Template/refs/heads/main/Run-on-ClawCloud.svg)](https://template.run.claw.cloud/?referralCode=U11MRQ8U9RM4&openapp=system-fastdeploy%3FtemplateName%3Dperplexica)\n[![Deploy on Hostinger](https://assets.hostinger.com/vps/deploy.svg)](https://www.hostinger.com/vps/docker-hosting?compose_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/refs/heads/master/docker-compose.yaml)\n\n## Upcoming Features\n\n- [x] Add settings page\n- [x] Adding support for local LLMs\n- [x] History Saving features\n- [x] Introducing various Focus Modes\n- [x] Adding API support\n- [x] Adding Discover\n- [ ] Finalizing Copilot Mode\n\n## Support Us\n\nIf you find Perplexica useful, consider giving us a star on GitHub.

You can find gRPC documentation [here](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/interfaces/#grpc-interface).\n\n## Features\n\n### Filtering and Payload\n\nQdrant can attach any JSON payloads to vectors, allowing for both the storage and filtering of data based on the values in these payloads.\nPayload supports a wide range of data types and query conditions, including keyword matching, full-text filtering, numerical ranges, geo-locations, and more.\n\nFiltering conditions can be combined in various ways, including `should`, `must`, and `must_not` clauses,\nensuring that you can implement any desired business logic on top of similarity matching.\n\n\n### Hybrid Search with Sparse Vectors\n\nTo address the limitations of vector embeddings when searching for specific keywords, Qdrant introduces support for sparse vectors in addition to the regular dense ones.\n\nSparse vectors can be viewed as an generalization of BM25 or TF-IDF ranking. They enable you to harness the capabilities of transformer-based neural networks to weigh individual tokens effectively.\n\n\n### Vector Quantization and On-Disk Storage\n\nQdrant provides multiple options to make vector search cheaper and more resource-efficient.\nBuilt-in vector quantization reduces RAM usage by up to 97% and dynamically manages the trade-off between search speed and precision.\n\n\n### Distributed Deployment\n\nQdrant offers comprehensive horizontal scaling support through two key mechanisms:\n1. Size expansion via sharding and throughput enhancement via replication\n2. Zero-downtime rolling updates and seamless dynamic scaling of the collections\n\n\n### Highlighted Features\n\n* **Query Planning and Payload Indexes** - leverages stored payload information to optimize query execution strategy.\n* **SIMD Hardware Acceleration** - utilizes modern CPU x86-x64 and Neon architectures to deliver better performance.\n* **Async I/O** - uses `io_uring` to maximize disk throughput utilization even on a network-attached storage.\n* **Write-Ahead Logging** - ensures data persistence with update confirmation, even during power outages.\n\n\n# Integrations\n\nExamples and/or documentation of Qdrant integrations:\n\n- [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/qdrant-and-cohere) ([blogpost on building a QA app with Cohere and Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/articles/qa-with-cohere-and-qdrant/)) - Use Cohere embeddings with Qdrant\n- [DocArray](https://docs.docarray.org/user_guide/storing/index_qdrant/) - Use Qdrant as a document store in DocArray\n- [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations/qdrant-document-store) - Use Qdrant as a document store with Haystack ([blogpost](https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/qdrant-integration)).\n- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/qdrant/) ([blogpost](https://qdrant.tech/articles/langchain-integration/)) - Use Qdrant as a memory backend for LangChain.\n- [LlamaIndex](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/QdrantIndexDemo.html) - Use Qdrant as a Vector Store with LlamaIndex.\n- [OpenAI - ChatGPT retrieval plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/blob/main/docs/providers/qdrant/setup.md) - Use Qdrant as a memory backend for ChatGPT\n- [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/the-power-of-persistent-memory-with-semantic-kernel-and-qdrant-vector-database/) - Use Qdrant as persistent memory with Semantic Kernel\n\n## Contacts\n\n- Have questions?

Rather than providing overwhelming amount of papers, We would like to provide a *curated list* of the awesome deep learning papers which are considered as *must-reads* in certain research domains.\n\n## Background\n\nBefore this list, there exist other *awesome deep learning lists*, for example, [Deep Vision](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision) and [Awesome Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-rnn). Also, after this list comes out, another awesome list for deep learning beginners, called [Deep Learning Papers Reading Roadmap](https://github.com/songrotek/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap), has been created and loved by many deep learning researchers.\n\nAlthough the *Roadmap List* includes lots of important deep learning papers, it feels overwhelming for me to read them all. As I mentioned in the introduction, I believe that seminal works can give us lessons regardless of their application domain. Thus, I would like to introduce **top 100 deep learning papers** here as a good starting point of overviewing deep learning researches.\n\nTo get the news for newly released papers everyday, follow my [twitter](https://twitter.com/TerryUm_ML) or [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/terryum.io/)! \n\n## Awesome list criteria\n\n1. A list of **top 100 deep learning papers** published from 2012 to 2016 is suggested.\n2. If a paper is added to the list, another paper (usually from *More Papers from 2016" section) should be removed to keep top 100 papers. (Thus, removing papers is also important contributions as well as adding papers)\n3. Papers that are important, but failed to be included in the list, will be listed in *More than Top 100* section.\n4. Please refer to *New Papers* and *Old Papers* sections for the papers published in recent 6 months or before 2012.\n\n*(Citation criteria)*\n- **< 6 months** : *New Papers* (by discussion)\n- **2016** :  +60 citations or "More Papers from 2016"\n- **2015** :  +200 citations\n- **2014** :  +400 citations\n- **2013** :  +600 citations\n- **2012** :  +800 citations\n- **~2012** : *Old Papers* (by discussion)\n\nPlease note that we prefer seminal deep learning papers that can be applied to various researches rather than application papers. For that reason, some papers that meet the criteria may not be accepted while others can be. It depends on the impact of the paper, applicability to other researches scarcity of the research domain, and so on.\n\n**We need your contributions!**\n\nIf you have any suggestions (missing papers, new papers, key researchers or typos), please feel free to edit and pull a request.\n(Please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/Contributing.md) for further instructions, though just letting me know the title of papers can also be a big contribution to us.)\n\n(Update) You can download all top-100 papers with [this](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/fetch_papers.py) and collect all authors'' names with [this](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/get_authors.py). Also, [bib file](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/top100papers.bib) for all top-100 papers are available.

It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in my O''Reilly book [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/):\n\n[![book](http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/9781491962282/cat.gif)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/)\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything?\nUse any of the following services.\n\n**WARNING**: Please be aware that these services provide temporary environments: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you download any data you care about.\n\n* **Recommended**: open this repository in [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/):\n<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon.ico" width="90" /></a>\n\n* Or open it in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ageron/handson-ml/master):\n<a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ageron/handson-ml/master"><img src="https://matthiasbussonnier.com/posts/img/binder_logo_128x128.png" width="90" /></a>\n\n  * _Note_: Most of the time, Binder starts up quickly and works great, but when handson-ml is updated, Binder creates a new environment from scratch, and this can take quite some time.\n\n* Or open it in [Deepnote](https://beta.deepnote.com/launch?template=data-science&url=https%3A//github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb):\n<a href="https://beta.deepnote.com/launch?template=data-science&url=https%3A//github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb"><img src="https://www.deepnote.com/static/illustration.png" width="150" /></a>\n\n### Just want to quickly look at some notebooks, without executing any code?\n\nBrowse this repository using [jupyter.org''s notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb):\n<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb"><img src="https://jupyter.org/assets/logos/rectanglelogo-greytext-orangebody-greymoons.svg" width="150" /></a>\n\n_Note_: [github.com''s notebook viewer](index.ipynb) also works but it is slower and the math equations are not always displayed correctly.\n\n### Want to run this project using a Docker image?\nRead the [Docker instructions](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/docker).\n\n### Want to install this project on your own machine?\n\nStart by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)), [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and if you have a TensorFlow-compatible GPU, install the [GPU driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx), as well as the appropriate version of CUDA and cuDNN (see TensorFlow''s documentation for more details).\n\nNext, clone this project by opening a terminal and typing the following commands (do not type the first `$` signs on each line, they just indicate that these are terminal commands):\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml.git\n    $ cd handson-ml\n\nNext, run the following commands:\n\n    $ conda env create -f environment.yml\n    $ conda activate tf1\n    $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python3\n\nFinally, start Jupyter:\n\n    $ jupyter notebook\n\nIf you need further instructions, read the [detailed installation instructions](INSTALL.md).\n\n# FAQ\n\n**Which Python version should I use?**\n\nI recommend Python 3.7. If you follow the installation instructions above, that''s the version you will get. Most code will work with other versions of Python 3, but some libraries do not support Python 3.8 or 3.9 yet, which is why I recommend Python 3.7.\n\n**I''m getting an error when I call `load_housing_data()`**\n\nMake sure you call `fetch_housing_data()` *before* you call `load_housing_data()`. If you''re getting an HTTP error, make sure you''re running the exact same code as in the notebook (copy/paste it if needed). If the problem persists, please check your network configuration.\n\n**I''m getting an SSL error on MacOSX**\n\nYou probably need to install the SSL certificates (see this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27835619/urllib-and-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-error)). If you downloaded Python from the official website, then run `/Applications/Python\ 3.7/Install\ Certificates.command` in a terminal (change `3.7` to whatever version you installed). If you installed Python using MacPorts, run `sudo port install curl-ca-bundle` in a terminal.\n\n**I''ve installed this project locally. How do I update it to the latest version?**\n\nSee [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)\n\n**How do I update my Python libraries to the latest versions, when using Anaconda?**\n\nSee [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)\n\n## Contributors\nI would like to thank everyone [who contributed to this project](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/graphs/contributors), either by providing useful feedback, filing issues or submitting Pull Requests. Special thanks go to Haesun Park and Ian Beauregard who reviewed every notebook and submitted many PRs, including help on some of the exercise solutions. Thanks as well to Steven Bunkley and Ziembla who created the `docker` directory, and to github user SuperYorio who helped on some exercise solutions.\n\n</details>\n', '{"language":"Jupyter Notebook","stars":25797,"forks":12877,"watchers":25797,"open_issues":144,"topics":["deep-learning","deprecated","distributed","jupyter-notebook","machine-learning","ml","neural-network","python","scikit-learn","tensorflow"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":87255,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ageron:handson-ml3\">THIRD","source_url":"https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3\">THIRD"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ageron:handson-ml","source_url":"https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ageron:handson-ml.git","source_url":"https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml.git"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ageron:handson-ml","source_url":"https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 65, '0e2397a3a8f44c40c97454288d5c9aae', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
