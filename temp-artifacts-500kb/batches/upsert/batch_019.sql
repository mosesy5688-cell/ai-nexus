It\nabstracts away hardware complexity so you can run the most popular open\nmodels with industry-leading GPU and CPU performance without any code changes.\n\n![](https://docs.modular.com/images/modular-container-stack.png?20250513)\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don''t need to clone this repo.\n\nYou can install Modular as a `pip` or `conda` package and then start an\nOpenAI-compatible endpoint with a model of your choice.\n\nTo get started with the Modular Platform and serve a model using the MAX\nframework, see [the quickstart guide](https://docs.modular.com/max/get-started).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Nightly vs. stable releases**\n> If you cloned the repo and want a stable release, run\n  `git checkout modular/vX.X` to match the version.\n> The `main` branch tracks nightly builds, while the `stable` branch matches\n  the latest released version.\n\nAfter your model endpoint is up and running, you can start sending the model\ninference requests using\n[our OpenAI-compatible REST API](https://docs.modular.com/max/api/serve).\n\nTry running hundreds of other models from\n[our model repository](https://builds.modular.com/?category=models).\n\n## Deploy our container\n\nThe MAX container is our Kubernetes-compatible Docker container for convenient\ndeployment, which uses the MAX framework''s built-in inference server. We have\nseparate containers for NVIDIA and AMD GPU environments, and a unified container\nthat works with both.\n\nFor example, you can start a container for an NVIDIA GPU with this command:\n\n```sh\ndocker run --gpus=1 \\n    -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \\n    -p 8000:8000 \\n    modular/max-nvidia-full:latest \\n    --model-path google/gemma-3-27b-it\n```\n\nFor more information, see our [MAX container\ndocs](https://docs.modular.com/max/container) or the [Modular Docker Hub\nrepository](https://hub.docker.com/u/modular).\n\n## About the repo\n\nWe''re constantly open-sourcing more of the Modular Platform and you can find\nall of it in here. As of May, 2025, this repo includes over 450,000 lines of\ncode from over 6000 contributors, providing developers with production-grade\nreference implementations and tools to extend the Modular Platform with new\nalgorithms, operations, and hardware targets. It is quite likely **the world''s\nlargest repository of open source CPU and GPU kernels**!\n\nHighlights include:\n\n- Mojo standard library: [/mojo/stdlib](mojo/stdlib)\n- MAX GPU and CPU kernels: [/max/kernels](max/kernels) (Mojo kernels)\n- MAX inference server: [/max/serve](max/serve) (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)\n- MAX model pipelines: [/max/pipelines](max/pipelines) (Python-based graphs)\n- Code example: [/examples](examples)\n\nThis repo has two major branches:\n\n- The [`main`](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main) branch, which is\nin sync with the nightly build and subject to new bugs. Use this branch for\n[contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md), or if you [installed the nightly\nbuild](https://docs.modular.com/max/packages).\n\n- The [`stable`](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/stable) branch, which\nis in sync with the last stable released version of Mojo. Use the examples in\nhere if you [installed the stable\nbuild](https://docs.modular.com/max/packages).\n\n## News & Announcements\n\n**[2025/11]** [Modular Platform 25.7][25.7] provides a fully open MAX Python\nAPI, expanded hardware support for NVIDIA Grace superchips, improved Mojo GPU\nprogramming experience, and much more.\n\n**[2025/11]** We met with the community at\n[PyTorch 2025 + the LLVM Developers'' Meeting][pytorch-llvm] to solicit\ncommunity input into how the Modular platform can reduce fragmentation and\nprovide a unified AI stack.\n\n**[2025/09]** [Modular raises $250M][funding] to scale AI''s unified compute\nlayer, bringing total funding to $380M at a $1.6B valuation.\n\n**[2025/09]** [Modular Platform 25.6][25.6] delivers a unified compute layer\nspanning from laptops to datacenter GPUs, with industry-leading throughput on\nNVIDIA Blackwell (B200) and AMD MI355X.\n\n**[2025/08]** [Modular Platform 25.5][25.5] introduces Large Scale Batch\nInference through a partnership with SF Compute + open source launch of the\nMAX Graph API and more.\n\n**[2025/08]** We hosted our [Los Altos Meetup][la-meetup] featuring talks from\nChris Lattner on democratizing AI compute and Inworld AI on production voice AI.\n\n**[2025/06]** [AMD partnership announced][amd] — Modular Platform now generally\navailable across AMD''s MI300 and MI325 GPU portfolio.\n\n**[2025/06]** [Modular Hack Weekend][hack-weekend] brought developers together\nto build custom kernels, model architectures, and PyTorch custom ops with\nMojo and MAX.\n\n**[2025/05]** Over 100 engineers gathered at AGI House for our first\n[GPU Kernel Hackathon][hackathon], featuring talks from Modular and\nAnthropic engineers.\n\n[25.7]: https://www.modular.com/blog/modular-25-7-faster-inference-safer-gpu-programming-and-a-more-unified-developer-experience\n[pytorch-llvm]: https://www.modular.com/blog/pytorch-and-llvm-in-2025-keeping-up-with-ai-innovation\n[25.6]: https://www.modular.com/blog/modular-25-6-unifying-the-latest-gpus-from-nvidia-amd-and-apple\n[25.5]: https://www.modular.com/blog/modular-platform-25-5\n[la-meetup]: https://lu.ma/modular-aug-meetup\n[amd]: https://www.modular.com/blog/modular-x-amd-unleashing-ai-performance-on-amd-gpus\n[hack-weekend]: https://www.meetup.com/modular-meetup-group/events/308311461/\n[hackathon]: https://www.modular.com/blog/modverse-48\n[dec-meetup]: https://www.meetup.com/modular-meetup-group/events/311998048/\n[meetup-group]: https://www.meetup.com/modular-meetup-group/\n\n---\n\n## Community & Events\n\nWe host regular meetups, hackathons, and community calls.

Fast C++ implementations are supported for *XGBoost*, *LightGBM*, *CatBoost*, *scikit-learn* and *pyspark* tree models:\n\n```python\nimport xgboost\nimport shap\n\n# train an XGBoost model\nX, y = shap.datasets.california()\nmodel = xgboost.XGBRegressor().fit(X, y)\n\n# explain the model''s predictions using SHAP\n# (same syntax works for LightGBM, CatBoost, scikit-learn, transformers, Spark, etc.)\nexplainer = shap.Explainer(model)\nshap_values = explainer(X)\n\n# visualize the first prediction''s explanation\nshap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="616" src="./docs/artwork/california_waterfall.png" />\n</p>\n\nThe above explanation shows features each contributing to push the model output from the base value (the average model output over the training dataset we passed) to the model output. Features pushing the prediction higher are shown in red, those pushing the prediction lower are in blue. Another way to visualize the same explanation is to use a force plot (these are introduced in our [Nature BME paper](https://rdcu.be/baVbR)):\n\n```python\n# visualize the first prediction''s explanation with a force plot\nshap.plots.force(shap_values[0])\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="811" src="./docs/artwork/california_instance.png" />\n</p>\n\nIf we take many force plot explanations such as the one shown above, rotate them 90 degrees, and then stack them horizontally, we can see explanations for an entire dataset (in the notebook this plot is interactive):\n\n```python\n# visualize all the training set predictions\nshap.plots.force(shap_values[:500])\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="811" src="./docs/artwork/california_dataset.png" />\n</p>\n\nTo understand how a single feature effects the output of the model we can plot the SHAP value of that feature vs. the value of the feature for all the examples in a dataset. Since SHAP values represent a feature''s responsibility for a change in the model output, the plot below represents the change in predicted house price as the latitude changes. Vertical dispersion at a single value of latitude represents interaction effects with other features. To help reveal these interactions we can color by another feature. If we pass the whole explanation tensor to the `color` argument the scatter plot will pick the best feature to color by. In this case it picks longitude.\n\n```python\n# create a dependence scatter plot to show the effect of a single feature across the whole dataset\nshap.plots.scatter(shap_values[:, "Latitude"], color=shap_values)\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="544" src="./docs/artwork/california_scatter.png" />\n</p>\n\n\nTo get an overview of which features are most important for a model we can plot the SHAP values of every feature for every sample. The plot below sorts features by the sum of SHAP value magnitudes over all samples, and uses SHAP values to show the distribution of the impacts each feature has on the model output. The color represents the feature value (red high, blue low). This reveals for example that higher median incomes increases the predicted home price.\n\n```python\n# summarize the effects of all the features\nshap.plots.beeswarm(shap_values)\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="583" src="./docs/artwork/california_beeswarm.png" />\n</p>\n\nWe can also just take the mean absolute value of the SHAP values for each feature to get a standard bar plot (produces stacked bars for multi-class outputs):\n\n```python\nshap.plots.bar(shap_values)\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="570" src="./docs/artwork/california_global_bar.png" />\n</p>\n\n## Natural language example (transformers)\n\nSHAP has specific support for natural language models like those in the Hugging Face transformers library. By adding coalitional rules to traditional Shapley values we can form games that explain large modern NLP model using very few function evaluations. Using this functionality is as simple as passing a supported transformers pipeline to SHAP:\n\n```python\nimport transformers\nimport shap\n\n# load a transformers pipeline model\nmodel = transformers.pipeline(''sentiment-analysis'', return_all_scores=True)\n\n# explain the model on two sample inputs\nexplainer = shap.Explainer(model)\nshap_values = explainer(["What a great movie! ...if you have no taste."])\n\n# visualize the first prediction''s explanation for the POSITIVE output class\nshap.plots.text(shap_values[0, :, "POSITIVE"])\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="811" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shap/shap/master/docs/artwork/sentiment_analysis_plot.png" />\n</p>\n\n## Deep learning example with DeepExplainer (TensorFlow/Keras models)\n\nDeep SHAP is a high-speed approximation algorithm for SHAP values in deep learning models that builds on a connection with [DeepLIFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02685) described in the SHAP NIPS paper. The implementation here differs from the original DeepLIFT by using a distribution of background samples instead of a single reference value, and using Shapley equations to linearize components such as max, softmax, products, divisions, etc. Note that some of these enhancements have also been since integrated into DeepLIFT. TensorFlow models and Keras models using the TensorFlow backend are supported (there is also preliminary support for PyTorch):\n\n```python\n# ...include code from https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/demo_mnist_convnet.py\n\nimport shap\nimport numpy as np\n\n# select a set of background examples to take an expectation over\nbackground = x_train[np.random.choice(x_train.shape[0], 100, replace=False)]\n\n# explain predictions of the model on four images\ne = shap.DeepExplainer(model, background)\n# ...or pass tensors directly\n# e = shap.DeepExplainer((model.layers[0].input, model.layers[-1].output), background)\nshap_values = e.shap_values(x_test[1:5])\n\n# plot the feature attributions\nshap.image_plot(shap_values, -x_test[1:5])\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="820" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shap/shap/master/docs/artwork/mnist_image_plot.png" />\n</p>\n\nThe plot above explains ten outputs (digits 0-9) for four different images. Red pixels increase the model''s output while blue pixels decrease the output. The input images are shown on the left, and as nearly transparent grayscale backings behind each of the explanations. The sum of the SHAP values equals the difference between the expected model output (averaged over the background dataset) and the current model output. Note that for the ''zero'' image the blank middle is important, while for the ''four'' image the lack of a connection on top makes it a four instead of a nine.\n\n\n## Deep learning example with GradientExplainer (TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch models)\n\nExpected gradients combines ideas from [Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365), SHAP, and [SmoothGrad](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03825) into a single expected value equation. This allows an entire dataset to be used as the background distribution (as opposed to a single reference value) and allows local smoothing. If we approximate the model with a linear function between each background data sample and the current input to be explained, and we assume the input features are independent then expected gradients will compute approximate SHAP values. In the example below we have explained how the 7th intermediate layer of the VGG16 ImageNet model impacts the output probabilities.\n\n```python\nfrom keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16\nfrom keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input\nimport keras.backend as K\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\nimport shap\n\n# load pre-trained model and choose two images to explain\nmodel = VGG16(weights=''imagenet'', include_top=True)\nX,y = shap.datasets.imagenet50()\nto_explain = X[[39,41]]\n\n# load the ImageNet class names\nurl = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/deep-learning-models/image-models/imagenet_class_index.json"\nfname = shap.datasets.cache(url)\nwith open(fname) as f:\n    class_names = json.load(f)\n\n# explain how the input to the 7th layer of the model explains the top two classes\ndef map2layer(x, layer):\n    feed_dict = dict(zip([model.layers[0].input], [preprocess_input(x.copy())]))\n    return K.get_session().run(model.layers[layer].input, feed_dict)\ne = shap.GradientExplainer(\n    (model.layers[7].input, model.layers[-1].output),\n    map2layer(X, 7),\n    local_smoothing=0 # std dev of smoothing noise\n)\nshap_values,indexes = e.shap_values(map2layer(to_explain, 7), ranked_outputs=2)\n\n# get the names for the classes\nindex_names = np.vectorize(lambda x: class_names[str(x)][1])(indexes)\n\n# plot the explanations\nshap.image_plot(shap_values, to_explain, index_names)\n```\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shap/shap/master/docs/artwork/gradient_imagenet_plot.png" />\n</p>\n\nPredictions for two input images are explained in the plot above. Red pixels represent positive SHAP values that increase the probability of the class, while blue pixels represent negative SHAP values the reduce the probability of the class. By using `ranked_outputs=2` we explain only the two most likely classes for each input (this spares us from explaining all 1,000 classes).\n\n## Model agnostic example with KernelExplainer (explains any function)\n\nKernel SHAP uses a specially-weighted local linear regression to estimate SHAP values for any model. Below is a simple example for explaining a multi-class SVM on the classic iris dataset.\n\n```python\nimport sklearn\nimport shap\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# print the JS visualization code to the notebook\nshap.initjs()\n\n# train a SVM classifier\nX_train,X_test,Y_train,Y_test = train_test_split(*shap.datasets.iris(), test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\nsvm = sklearn.svm.SVC(kernel=''rbf'', probability=True)\nsvm.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n\n# use Kernel SHAP to explain test set predictions\nexplainer = shap.KernelExplainer(svm.predict_proba, X_train, link="logit")\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test, nsamples=100)\n\n# plot the SHAP values for the Setosa output of the first instance\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0][0,:], X_test.iloc[0,:], link="logit")\n```\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="810" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shap/shap/master/docs/artwork/iris_instance.png" />\n</p>\n\nThe above explanation shows four features each contributing to push the model output from the base value (the average model output over the training dataset we passed) towards zero. If there were any features pushing the class label higher they would be shown in red.\n\nIf we take many explanations such as the one shown above, rotate them 90 degrees, and then stack them horizontally, we can see explanations for an entire dataset. This is exactly what we do below for all the examples in the iris test set:\n\n```python\n# plot the SHAP values for the Setosa output of all instances\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0], X_test, link="logit")\n```\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="813" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shap/shap/master/docs/artwork/iris_dataset.png" />\n</p>\n\n## SHAP Interaction Values\n\nSHAP interaction values are a generalization of SHAP values to higher order interactions. Fast exact computation of pairwise interactions are implemented for tree models with `shap.TreeExplainer(model).shap_interaction_values(X)`. This returns a matrix for every prediction, where the main effects are on the diagonal and the interaction effects are off-diagonal. These values often reveal interesting hidden relationships, such as how the increased risk of death peaks for men at age 60 (see the NHANES notebook for details):\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="483" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shap/shap/master/docs/artwork/nhanes_age_sex_interaction.png" />\n</p>\n\n## Sample notebooks\n\nThe notebooks below demonstrate different use cases for SHAP. Look inside the notebooks directory of the repository if you want to try playing with the original notebooks yourself.\n\n### TreeExplainer\n\nAn implementation of Tree SHAP, a fast and exact algorithm to compute SHAP values for trees and ensembles of trees.\n\n- [**NHANES survival model with XGBoost and SHAP interaction values**](https://shap.github.io/shap/notebooks/NHANES%20I%20Survival%20Model.html) - Using mortality data from 20 years of followup this notebook demonstrates how to use XGBoost and `shap` to uncover complex risk factor relationships.\n\n- [**Census income classification with LightGBM**](https://shap.github.io/shap/notebooks/tree_explainer/Census%20income%20classification%20with%20LightGBM.html) - Using the standard adult census income dataset, this notebook trains a gradient boosting tree model with LightGBM and then explains predictions using `shap`.\n\n- [**League of Legends Win Prediction with XGBoost**](https://shap.github.io/shap/notebooks/League%20of%20Legends%20Win%20Prediction%20with%20XGBoost.html) - Using a Kaggle dataset of 180,000 ranked matches from League of Legends we train and explain a gradient boosting tree model with XGBoost to predict if a player will win their match.\n\n### DeepExplainer\n\nAn implementation of Deep SHAP, a faster (but only approximate) algorithm to compute SHAP values for deep learning models that is based on connections between SHAP and the DeepLIFT algorithm.\n\n- [**MNIST Digit classification with Keras**](https://shap.github.io/shap/notebooks/deep_explainer/Front%20Page%20DeepExplainer%20MNIST%20Example.html) - Using the MNIST handwriting recognition dataset, this notebook trains a neural network with Keras and then explains predictions using `shap`.\n\n- [**Keras LSTM for IMDB Sentiment Classification**](https://shap.github.io/shap/notebooks/deep_explainer/Keras%20LSTM%20for%20IMDB%20Sentiment%20Classification.html) - This notebook trains an LSTM with Keras on the IMDB text sentiment analysis dataset and then explains predictions using `shap`.\n\n### GradientExplainer\n\nAn implementation of expected gradients to approximate SHAP values for deep learning models. It is based on connections between SHAP and the Integrated Gradients algorithm. GradientExplainer is slower than DeepExplainer and makes different approximation assumptions.\n\n- [**Explain an Intermediate Layer of VGG16 on ImageNet**](https://shap.github.io/shap/notebooks/gradient_explainer/Explain%20an%20Intermediate%20Layer%20of%20VGG16%20on%20ImageNet.html) - This notebook demonstrates how to explain the output of a pre-trained VGG16 ImageNet model using an internal convolutional layer.\n\n### LinearExplainer\n\nFor a linear model with independent features we can analytically compute the exact SHAP values. We can also account for feature correlation if we are willing to estimate the feature covariance matrix. LinearExplainer supports both of these options.\n\n- [**Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression**](https://shap.github.io/shap/notebooks/linear_explainer/Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.html) - This notebook demonstrates how to explain a linear logistic regression sentiment analysis model.\n\n### KernelExplainer\n\nAn implementation of Kernel SHAP, a model agnostic method to estimate SHAP values for any model.

The coefficients in these superpositions are real numbers, not complex numbers, so it doesn''t do the actual quantum mechanics, but it was inspired by QM. Then the program goes into the observation-propagation cycle:\n\n* On each observation step an NxN region is chosen among the unobserved which has the lowest Shannon entropy. This region''s state then collapses into a definite state according to its coefficients and the distribution of NxN patterns in the input.\n* On each propagation step new information gained from the collapse on the previous step propagates through the output.\n\nOn each step the number of non-zero coefficients decreases and in the end we have a completely observed state, the wave function has collapsed.\n\nIt may happen that during propagation all the coefficients for a certain pixel become zero. That means that the algorithm has run into a contradiction and can not continue. The problem of determining whether a certain bitmap allows other nontrivial bitmaps satisfying condition (C1) is NP-hard, so it''s impossible to create a fast solution that always finishes. In practice, however, the algorithm runs into contradictions surprisingly rarely.\n\nWave Function Collapse algorithm has been implemented in\n[C++](https://github.com/math-fehr/fast-wfc),\n[Python](https://github.com/ikarth/wfc_2019f),\n[Kotlin](https://github.com/j-roskopf/WFC),\n[Rust](https://github.com/Elwqnn/wfc),\n[Julia](https://github.com/roberthoenig/WaveFunctionCollapse.jl),\n[Go](https://github.com/shawnridgeway/wfc),\n[Haxe](https://github.com/Mitim-84/WFC-Gen),\n[Java](https://github.com/sjcasey21/wavefunctioncollapse),\n[Clojure](https://github.com/sjcasey21/wavefunctioncollapse-clj),\n[Free Pascal](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/mini_projects/tree/main/miniprojects/Wave_function_collapse/Overlap_model),\n[Dart](https://github.com/rick-dalley/wfc),\n[p5js](https://github.com/D-T-666/wave-function-collapse-p5),\n[JavaScript](https://github.com/kchapelier/wavefunctioncollapse)\nand adapted to [Unity](https://selfsame.itch.io/unitywfc),\n[Unreal Engine 5](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/BlueprintAPI/WaveFunctionCollapse/)\nand [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/wfc-dungeon-generator/).\nYou can [build WFC from source](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse#how-to-build),\ndownload an official [release](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/releases) for Windows,\ndownload an interactive graphical version from [itch.io](https://exutumno.itch.io/wavefunctioncollapse)\nor [run it in the browser](http://www.kchapelier.com/wfc-example/overlapping-model.html).\nWFC generates levels in [Bad North](https://www.badnorth.com/),\n[Caves of Qud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/),\n[Dead Static Drive](https://twitter.com/deadstaticdrive),\n[Townscaper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291340/Townscaper/),\n[Matrix Awakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usJrcwN6T4I),\n[several](https://arcadia-clojure.itch.io/proc-skater-2016)\n[smaller](https://arcadia-clojure.itch.io/swapland)\n[games](https://marian42.itch.io/wfc) and many prototypes.\nIt led to [new](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3rm1w0mn)\n[research](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01706539v3/document).\nFor [more](https://twitter.com/OskSta/status/784847588893814785)\n[related](https://twitter.com/dwtw/status/810166761270243328)\n[work](https://github.com/mewo2/oisin),\n[explanations](https://trasevol.dog/2017/09/01/di19/),\n[interactive demos](http://oskarstalberg.com/game/wave/wave.html),\n[guides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zeiat1w8zre9ro8/Knots%20breakdown.png?dl=0),\n[tutorials](http://www.procjam.com/tutorials/wfc/)\nand [examples](https://twitter.com/ExUtumno/status/895684431477747715)\nsee the [ports, forks and spinoffs section](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse#notable-ports-forks-and-spinoffs).\n\nWatch a video demonstration of WFC algorithm on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/DOQTr2Xmlz0](https://youtu.be/DOQTr2Xmlz0)\n\n## Algorithm\n1. Read the input bitmap and count NxN patterns.\n    1. (optional) Augment pattern data with rotations and reflections.\n2. Create an array with the dimensions of the output (called "wave" in the source). Each element of this array represents a state of an NxN region in the output. A state of an NxN region is a superposition of NxN patterns of the input with boolean coefficients (so a state of a pixel in the output is a superposition of input colors with real coefficients). False coefficient means that the corresponding pattern is forbidden, true coefficient means that the corresponding pattern is not yet forbidden.\n3. Initialize the wave in the completely unobserved state, i.e. with all the boolean coefficients being true.\n4. Repeat the following steps:\n    1. Observation:\n        1. Find a wave element with the minimal nonzero entropy. If there is no such elements (if all elements have zero or undefined entropy) then break the cycle (4) and go to step (5).\n        2. Collapse this element into a definite state according to its coefficients and the distribution of NxN patterns in the input.\n    2. Propagation: propagate information gained on the previous observation step.\n5. By now all the wave elements are either in a completely observed state (all the coefficients except one being zero) or in the contradictory state (all the coefficients being zero). In the first case return the output. In the second case finish the work without returning anything.\n\n## Tilemap generation\nThe simplest nontrivial case of the algorithm is when NxN=1x2 (well, NxM). If we simplify it even further by storing not the probabilities of pairs of colors but the probabilities of colors themselves, we get what we call a "simple tiled model". The propagation phase in this model is just adjacency constraint propagation. It''s convenient to initialize the simple tiled model with a list of tiles and their adjacency data (adjacency data can be viewed as a large set of very small samples) rather than a sample bitmap.\n<p align="center"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jIctSoT.gifv"><img src="images/tile.gif"/></a></p>\n<!--<p align="center">\n  <a href="images/tile.gif">GIF</a> |\n  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jIctSoT.gifv">GIFV</a>\n</p>-->\n\nLists of all the possible pairs of adjacent tiles in practical tilesets can be quite long, so I implemented a symmetry system for tiles to shorten the enumeration. In this system each tile should be assigned with its symmetry type.\n<p align="center"><img alt="symmetries" src="images/symmetry-system.png"></p>\n\nNote that the tiles have the same symmetry type as their assigned letters (or, in other words, actions of the \ndihedral group D4 are isomorphic for tiles and their corresponding letters). With this system it''s enough to enumerate pairs of adjacent tiles only up to symmetry, which makes lists of adjacencies for tilesets with many symmetrical tiles (even the summer tileset, despite drawings not being symmetrical the system considers such tiles to be symmetrical) several times shorter.\n<p align="center">\n<img alt="knots" src="images/knots.png">\n<img alt="tiled rooms" src="images/rooms.png">\n<img alt="circuit 1" src="images/circuit-1.png">\n<img alt="circuit 2" src="images/circuit-2.png">\n<img alt="circles" src="images/circles.png">\n<img alt="castle" src="images/castle.png">\n<img alt="summer 1" src="images/summer-1.png">\n<img alt="summer 2" src="images/summer-2.png">\n</p>\n\nNote that the unrestrained knot tileset (with all 5 tiles being allowed) is not interesting for WFC, because you can''t run into a situation where you can''t place a tile. We call tilesets with this property "easy". Without special heuristics easy tilesets don''t produce interesting global arrangements, because correlations of tiles in easy tilesets quickly fall off with a distance. Many easy tilesets can be found on [Guy Walker''s website](http://cr31.co.uk/stagecast/wang/tiles_e.html). Consider the "Dual" 2-edge tileset there. How can it generate knots (without t-junctions, not easy) while being easy? The answer is, it can only generate a narrow class of knots, it can''t produce an arbitrary knot.\n\nNote also that Circuit, Summer and Rooms tilesets are non-Wang. That is, their adjacency data cannot be induced from edge labels. For example, in Circuit two Corners cannot be adjacent, yet they can be connected with a Connection tile, and diagonal tracks cannot change direction.\n\n## Higher dimensions\nWFC algorithm in higher dimensions works completely the same way as in dimension 2, though performance becomes an issue. These voxel models were generated with N=2 overlapping tiled model using 5x5x5 and 5x5x2 blocks and additional heuristics (height, density, curvature, ...).\n<p align="center"><img alt="voxels" src="images/castles-3d.png"></p>\n\nHigher resolution screenshots: [1](http://i.imgur.com/0bsjlBY.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/GduN0Vr.png), [3](http://i.imgur.com/IEOsbIy.png).\n\n[MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) repository contains an implementation of the 3d simple tiled model with many [tilesets](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior/tree/main/resources/tilesets) and [examples](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior/blob/main/images/top-1764.png).\n\n## Constrained synthesis\nWFC algorithm supports constraints. Therefore, it can be easily combined with other generative algorithms or with manual creation.\n\nHere is WFC autocompleting a level started by a human:\n<p align="center"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/X3aNDUv.gifv"><img src="images/constrained.gif"/></a></p>\n<!--<p align="center">\n  <a href="images/constrained.gif">GIF</a> |\n  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/X3aNDUv.gifv">GIFV</a>\n</p>-->\n\n[ConvChain](https://github.com/mxgmn/ConvChain) algorithm satisfies the strong version of the condition (C2): the limit distribution of NxN patterns in the outputs it is producing is exactly the same as the distributions of patterns in the input. However, ConvChain doesn''t satisfy (C1): it often produces noticeable defects. It makes sense to run ConvChain first to get a well-sampled configuration and then run WFC to correct local defects. This is similar to a common strategy in optimization: first run a Monte-Carlo method to find a point close to a global optimum and then run a gradient descent from that point for greater accuracy.\n\nP. F. Harrison''s [texture synthesis](https://github.com/mxgmn/TextureSynthesis) algorithm is significantly faster than WFC, but it has trouble with long correlations (for example, it''s difficult for this algorithm to synthesize brick wall textures with correctly aligned bricks). But this is exactly where WFC shines, and Harrison''s algorithm supports constraints. It makes sense first to generate a perfect brick wall blueprint with WFC and then run a constrained texture synthesis algorithm on that blueprint.\n\n## Comments\nWhy the minimal entropy heuristic? I noticed that when humans draw something they often follow the [minimal entropy heuristic](images/lowest-entropy-heuristic.gif) themselves. That''s why the algorithm is so enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe overlapping model relates to the simple tiled model the same way higher order Markov chains relate to order one Markov chains.\n\nWFC''s propagation phase is very similar to the loopy belief propagation algorithm. In fact, I first programmed belief propagation, but then switched to constraint propagation with a saved stationary distribution, because BP is significantly slower without a massive parallelization (on a CPU) and didn''t produce significantly better results in my problems.\n\nNote that the "Simple Knot" and "Trick Knot" samples have 3 colors, not 2.\n\nOne of the dimensions can be time. In particular, d-dimensional WFC captures the behaviour of any (d-1)-dimensional cellular automata.\n\n## Used work\n1. Alexei A. Efros and Thomas K. Leung, [Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/papers/efros-iccv99.pdf), 1999. WaveFunctionCollapse is a [texture synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_synthesis) algorithm. Compared to the earlier texture synthesis algorithms, WFC guarantees that the output contains only those NxN patterns that are present in the input. This makes WFC perfect for level generation in games and pixel art, and less suited for large full-color textures.\n2. Paul C. Merrell, [Model Synthesis](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~pmerrell/thesis.pdf), 2009. Merrell derives adjacency constraints between tiles from an example model and generates a new larger model with the AC-3 algorithm. We generalize his approach to work with NxN overlapping patterns of tiles instead of individual tiles. This allows to use a single image as the input to the algorithm. By varying N, we can make the output look more like the input or less. We introduce the [lowest entropy heuristic](images/lowest-entropy-heuristic.gif) that removes the [directional bias](images/directional-bias.png) in generated results, is defined for irregular grids and is better suited for [pre-constrained problems](images/constrained.gif). We implement a tile symmetry system to reduce the sizes of inputs. We visualize partially observed states, either with [color averaging](images/wfc.gif) or [per-voxel voting](https://twitter.com/ExUtumno/status/900395635412787202). Merrell also introduced a method of incrementally modifying the model in parts to reduce the failure rate (which we don''t use here). Recently the author created a [page](https://paulmerrell.org/model-synthesis/) for model synthesis and published [code](https://github.com/merrell42/model-synthesis).\n3. Alan K. Mackworth, [Consistency in Networks of Relations](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mack/Publications/AI77.pdf), 1977. WFC translates a texture synthesis problem into a constraint satisfaction problem. Currently it uses the [AC-4 algorithm](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~tch/CS4300/resources/AC4.pdf) by Roger Mohr and Thomas C. Henderson, 1986.\n4. Paul F. Harrison, [Image Texture Tools](http://logarithmic.net/pfh-files/thesis/dissertation.pdf), 2005. WFC was also influenced by the declarative texture synthesis chapter of Paul Harrison''s dissertation. The author defines adjacency data of tiles by labeling their borders and uses backtracking search to fill the tilemap. A [demonstration of the algorithm](https://logarithmic.net/ghost.xhtml) is available on the web.\n\n## How to build\nWFC is a console application that depends only on the standard library. Get [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) for Windows, Linux or macOS and run\n```\ndotnet run --configuration Release WaveFunctionCollapse.csproj\n```\nGenerated results are saved into the `output` folder. Edit `samples.xml` to change model parameters.\n\nAlternatively, use build instructions from the community for various platforms from the [relevant issue](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/issues/3).

Each algorithm has interactive **Jupyter Notebook** demo that allows you to play with training data, algorithms configurations and immediately see the results, charts and predictions **right in your browser**. In most cases the explanations are based on [this great machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.\n\nThe purpose of this repository is _not_ to implement machine learning algorithms by using 3<sup>rd</sup> party library one-liners _but_ rather to practice implementing these algorithms from scratch and get better understanding of the mathematics behind each algorithm. That''s why all algorithms implementations are called "homemade" and not intended to be used for production.\n\n## Supervised Learning\n\nIn supervised learning we have a set of training data as an input and a set of labels or "correct answers" for each training set as an output. Then we''re training our model (machine learning algorithm parameters) to map the input to the output correctly (to do correct prediction). The ultimate purpose is to find such model parameters that will successfully continue correct _input→output_ mapping (predictions) even for new input examples.\n\n### Regression\n\nIn regression problems we do real value predictions. Basically we try to draw a line/plane/n-dimensional plane along the training examples.\n\n_Usage examples: stock price forecast, sales analysis, dependency of any number, etc._\n\n#### 🤖 Linear Regression\n\n- 📗 [Math | Linear Regression](homemade/linear_regression) - theory and links for further readings\n- ⚙️ [Code | Linear Regression](homemade/linear_regression/linear_regression.py) - implementation example\n- ▶️ [Demo | Univariate Linear Regression](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/linear_regression/univariate_linear_regression_demo.ipynb) - predict `country happiness` score by `economy GDP`\n- ▶️ [Demo | Multivariate Linear Regression](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/linear_regression/multivariate_linear_regression_demo.ipynb) - predict `country happiness` score by `economy GDP` and `freedom index`\n- ▶️ [Demo | Non-linear Regression](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/linear_regression/non_linear_regression_demo.ipynb) - use linear regression with _polynomial_ and _sinusoid_ features to predict non-linear dependencies\n\n### Classification\n\nIn classification problems we split input examples by certain characteristic.\n\n_Usage examples: spam-filters, language detection, finding similar documents, handwritten letters recognition, etc._\n\n#### 🤖 Logistic Regression\n\n- 📗 [Math | Logistic Regression](homemade/logistic_regression) - theory and links for further readings\n- ⚙️ [Code | Logistic Regression](homemade/logistic_regression/logistic_regression.py) - implementation example\n- ▶️ [Demo | Logistic Regression (Linear Boundary)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/logistic_regression/logistic_regression_with_linear_boundary_demo.ipynb) - predict Iris flower `class` based on `petal_length` and `petal_width`\n- ▶️ [Demo | Logistic Regression (Non-Linear Boundary)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/logistic_regression/logistic_regression_with_non_linear_boundary_demo.ipynb) - predict microchip `validity` based on `param_1` and `param_2`\n- ▶️ [Demo | Multivariate Logistic Regression | MNIST](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/logistic_regression/multivariate_logistic_regression_demo.ipynb) - recognize handwritten digits from `28x28` pixel images\n- ▶️ [Demo | Multivariate Logistic Regression | Fashion MNIST](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/logistic_regression/multivariate_logistic_regression_fashion_demo.ipynb) - recognize clothes types from `28x28` pixel images\n\n## Unsupervised Learning\n\nUnsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that learns from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning identifies commonalities in the data and reacts based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.\n\n### Clustering\n\nIn clustering problems we split the training examples by unknown characteristics. The algorithm itself decides what characteristic to use for splitting.\n\n_Usage examples: market segmentation, social networks analysis, organize computing clusters, astronomical data analysis, image compression, etc._\n\n#### 🤖 K-means Algorithm\n\n- 📗 [Math | K-means Algorithm](homemade/k_means) - theory and links for further readings\n- ⚙️ [Code | K-means Algorithm](homemade/k_means/k_means.py) - implementation example\n- ▶️ [Demo | K-means Algorithm](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/k_means/k_means_demo.ipynb) - split Iris flowers into clusters based on `petal_length` and `petal_width`\n\n### Anomaly Detection\n\nAnomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.\n\n_Usage examples: intrusion detection, fraud detection, system health monitoring, removing anomalous data from the dataset etc._\n\n#### 🤖 Anomaly Detection using Gaussian Distribution\n\n- 📗 [Math | Anomaly Detection using Gaussian Distribution](homemade/anomaly_detection) - theory and links for further readings\n- ⚙️ [Code | Anomaly Detection using Gaussian Distribution](homemade/anomaly_detection/gaussian_anomaly_detection.py) - implementation example\n- ▶️ [Demo | Anomaly Detection](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/anomaly_detection/anomaly_detection_gaussian_demo.ipynb) - find anomalies in server operational parameters like `latency` and `threshold`\n\n## Neural Network (NN)\n\nThe neural network itself isn''t an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.\n\n_Usage examples: as a substitute of all other algorithms in general, image recognition, voice recognition, image processing (applying specific style), language translation, etc._\n\n#### 🤖 Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\n\n- 📗 [Math | Multilayer Perceptron](homemade/neural_network) - theory and links for further readings\n- ⚙️ [Code | Multilayer Perceptron](homemade/neural_network/multilayer_perceptron.py) - implementation example\n- ▶️ [Demo | Multilayer Perceptron | MNIST](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/neural_network/multilayer_perceptron_demo.ipynb) - recognize handwritten digits from `28x28` pixel images\n- ▶️ [Demo | Multilayer Perceptron | Fashion MNIST](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning/blob/master/notebooks/neural_network/multilayer_perceptron_fashion_demo.ipynb) - recognize the type of clothes from `28x28` pixel images\n\n## Machine Learning Map\n\n![Machine Learning Map](images/machine-learning-map.png)\n\nThe source of the following machine learning topics map is [this wonderful blog post](https://vas3k.ru/blog/machine_learning/)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n#### Installing Python\n\nMake sure that you have [Python installed](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on your machine.\n\nYou might want to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) standard Python library\nto create virtual environments and have Python, `pip` and all dependent packages to be installed and \nserved from the local project directory to avoid messing with system wide packages and their \nversions.\n\n#### Installing Dependencies\n\nInstall all dependencies that are required for the project by running:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n#### Launching Jupyter Locally\n\nAll demos in the project may be run directly in your browser without installing Jupyter locally. But if you want to launch [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) locally you may do it by running the following command from the root folder of the project:\n\n```bash\njupyter notebook\n```\nAfter this Jupyter Notebook will be accessible by `http://localhost:8888`.\n\n#### Launching Jupyter Remotely\n\nEach algorithm section contains demo links to [Jupyter NBViewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). This is fast online previewer for Jupyter notebooks where you may see demo code, charts and data right in your browser without installing anything locally. In case if you want to _change_ the code and _experiment_ with demo notebook you need to launch the notebook in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). You may do it by simply clicking the _"Execute on Binder"_ link in top right corner of the NBViewer.\n\n![](./images/binder-button-place.png)\n\n## Datasets\n\nThe list of datasets that is being used for Jupyter Notebook demos may be found in [data folder](data).\n\n## Supporting the project\n\nYou may support this project via ❤️️ [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/trekhleb) or ❤️️ [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/trekhleb).\n\n## Author\n\n- [@trekhleb](https://trekhleb.dev)\n', '{"language":"Jupyter Notebook","stars":23787,"forks":4113,"watchers":23787,"open_issues":27,"topics":["algorithm","jupyter","jupyter-notebook","machine-learning","machine-learning-algorithms","machinelearning","python"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":14467,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:trekhleb:homemade-gpt-js","source_url":"https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade-gpt-js"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:trekhleb:machine-learning-experiments","source_url":"https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:trekhleb:machine-learning-octave","source_url":"https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-octave"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:sponsors:trekhleb","source_url":"https://github.com/sponsors/trekhleb"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 80, 'd50e2035d9a282bdc312875f4af44825', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

libraries.\n\n![Integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlflow/mlflow/refs/heads/master/assets/readme-integrations.png)\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Tracing (Observability) ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html))\n\nMLflow Tracing provides LLM observability for various GenAI libraries such as OpenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, AutoGen, and more. To enable auto-tracing, call `mlflow.xyz.autolog()` before running your models. Refer to the documentation for customization and manual instrumentation.\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\n# Enable tracing for OpenAI\nmlflow.openai.autolog()\n\n# Query OpenAI LLM normally\nresponse = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\n    model="gpt-4o-mini",\n    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}],\n    temperature=0.1,\n)\n```\n\nThen navigate to the "Traces" tab in the MLflow UI to find the trace records OpenAI query.\n\n### Evaluating LLMs, Prompts, and Agents ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/index.html))\n\nThe following example runs automatic evaluation for question-answering tasks with several built-in metrics.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport openai\nimport mlflow\nfrom mlflow.genai.scorers import Correctness, Guidelines\n\nclient = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))\n\n# 1. Define a simple QA dataset\ndataset = [\n    {\n        "inputs": {"question": "Can MLflow manage prompts?"},\n        "expectations": {"expected_response": "Yes!"},\n    },\n    {\n        "inputs": {"question": "Can MLflow create a taco for my lunch?"},\n        "expectations": {\n            "expected_response": "No, unfortunately, MLflow is not a taco maker."\n        },\n    },\n]\n\n\n# 2. Define a prediction function to generate responses\ndef predict_fn(question: str) -> str:\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}]\n    )\n    return response.choices[0].message.content\n\n\n# 3.Run the evaluation\nresults = mlflow.genai.evaluate(\n    data=dataset,\n    predict_fn=predict_fn,\n    scorers=[\n        # Built-in LLM judge\n        Correctness(),\n        # Custom criteria using LLM judge\n        Guidelines(name="is_english", guidelines="The answer must be in English"),\n    ],\n)\n```\n\nNavigate to the "Evaluations" tab in the MLflow UI to find the evaluation results.\n\n### Tracking Model Training ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/tracking/))\n\nThe following examples trains a simple regression model with scikit-learn, while enabling MLflow''s [autologging](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/autolog.html) feature for experiment tracking.\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\n# Enable MLflow''s automatic experiment tracking for scikit-learn\nmlflow.sklearn.autolog()\n\n# Load the training dataset\ndb = load_diabetes()\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(db.data, db.target)\n\nrf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, max_features=3)\n# MLflow triggers logging automatically upon model fitting\nrf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\nOnce the above code finishes, run the following command in a separate terminal and access the MLflow UI via the printed URL. An MLflow **Run** should be automatically created, which tracks the training dataset, hyper parameters, performance metrics, the trained model, dependencies, and even more.\n\n```\nmlflow server\n```\n\n## 💭 Support\n\n- For help or questions about MLflow usage (e.g. "how do I do X?") visit the [documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest).\n- In the documentation, you can ask the question to our AI-powered chat bot.

The main objective\nis to provide the reader with a quick overview of benchmark datasets and the state-of-the-art for their\ntask of interest, which serves as a stepping stone for further research. To this end, if there is a \nplace where results for a task are already published and regularly maintained, such as a public leaderboard,\nthe reader will be pointed there.\n\nIf you want to find this document again in the future, just go to [`nlpprogress.com`](https://nlpprogress.com/)\nor [`nlpsota.com`](http://nlpsota.com/) in your browser.\n\n### Contributing\n\n#### Guidelines\n\n**Results** &nbsp; Results reported in published papers are preferred; an exception may be made for influential preprints.\n\n**Datasets** &nbsp; Datasets should have been used for evaluation in at least one published paper besides \nthe one that introduced the dataset.\n\n**Code** &nbsp; We recommend to add a link to an implementation \nif available. You can add a `Code` column (see below) to the table if it does not exist.\nIn the `Code` column, indicate an official implementation with [Official](http://link_to_implementation).\nIf an unofficial implementation is available, use [Link](http://link_to_implementation) (see below).\nIf no implementation is available, you can leave the cell empty.\n\n#### Adding a new result\n\nIf you would like to add a new result, you can just click on the small edit button in the top-right\ncorner of the file for the respective task (see below).\n\n![Click on the edit button to add a file](img/edit_file.png)\n\nThis allows you to edit the file in Markdown. Simply add a row to the corresponding table in the\nsame format. Make sure that the table stays sorted (with the best result on top). \nAfter you''ve made your change, make sure that the table still looks ok by clicking on the\n"Preview changes" tab at the top of the page. If everything looks good, go to the bottom of the page,\nwhere you see the below form. \n\n![Fill out the file change information](img/propose_file_change.png)\n\nAdd a name for your proposed change, an optional description, indicate that you would like to\n"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request", and click on "Propose file change".\n\n#### Adding a new dataset or task\n\nFor adding a new dataset or task, you can also follow the steps above. Alternatively, you can fork the repository.\nIn both cases, follow the steps below:\n\n1. If your task is completely new, create a new file and link to it in the table of contents above.\n2. If not, add your task or dataset to the respective section of the corresponding file (in alphabetical order).\n3. Briefly describe the dataset/task and include relevant references. \n4. Describe the evaluation setting and evaluation metric.\n5. Show how an annotated example of the dataset/task looks like.\n6. Add a download link if available.\n7. Copy the below table and fill in at least two results (including the state-of-the-art)\n  for your dataset/task (change Score to the metric of your dataset). If your dataset/task\n  has multiple metrics, add them to the right of `Score`.\n1. Submit your change as a pull request.\n  \n| Model           | Score  |  Paper / Source | Code |\n| ------------- | :-----:| --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | |\n\n\n### Wish list\n\nThese are tasks and datasets that are still missing:\n\n- Bilingual dictionary induction\n- Discourse parsing\n- Keyphrase extraction\n- Knowledge base population (KBP)\n- More dialogue tasks\n- Semi-supervised learning\n- Frame-semantic parsing (FrameNet full-sentence analysis)\n\n### Exporting into a structured format\n\nYou can extract all the data into a structured, machine-readable JSON format with parsed tasks, descriptions and SOTA tables. \n\nThe instructions are in [structured/README.md](structured/README.md).\n\n### Instructions for building the site locally\n\nInstructions for building the website locally using Jekyll can be found [here](jekyll_instructions.md).\n\n\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":22973,"forks":3622,"watchers":22973,"open_issues":40,"topics":["dialogue","machine-learning","machine-translation","named-entity-recognition","natural-language-processing","nlp-tasks"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":1399,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":true}', '[]', '[]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 65, '0f9ab7689787985f284bafc31ef1ac60', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Structure your Executor:\n```\nTextToImage/\n├── executor.py\n├── config.yml\n├── requirements.txt\n```\n\n2. Configure:\n```yaml\n# config.yml\njtype: TextToImage\npy_modules:\n - executor.py\nmetas:\n name: TextToImage\n description: Text to Image generation Executor\n```\n\n3. Push to Hub:\n```bash\njina hub push TextToImage\n```\n\n#### Deploy to Kubernetes\n```bash\njina export kubernetes flow.yml ./my-k8s\nkubectl apply -R -f my-k8s\n```\n\n#### Use Docker Compose\n```bash\njina export docker-compose flow.yml docker-compose.yml\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\n#### JCloud Deployment\n\nDeploy with a single command:\n```bash\njina cloud deploy jcloud-flow.yml\n```\n\n## LLM Streaming\n\nEnable token-by-token streaming for responsive LLM applications:\n\n1. Define schemas:\n```python\nfrom docarray import BaseDoc\n\n\nclass PromptDocument(BaseDoc):\n    prompt: str\n    max_tokens: int\n\n\nclass ModelOutputDocument(BaseDoc):\n    token_id: int\n    generated_text: str\n```\n\n2. Initialize service:\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel\n\n\nclass TokenStreamingExecutor(Executor):\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(**kwargs)\n        self.model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(''gpt2'')\n```\n\n3. Implement streaming:\n```python\n@requests(on=''/stream'')\nasync def task(self, doc: PromptDocument, **kwargs) -> ModelOutputDocument:\n    input = tokenizer(doc.prompt, return_tensors=''pt'')\n    input_len = input[''input_ids''].shape[1]\n    for _ in range(doc.max_tokens):\n        output = self.model.generate(**input, max_new_tokens=1)\n        if output[0][-1] == tokenizer.eos_token_id:\n            break\n        yield ModelOutputDocument(\n            token_id=output[0][-1],\n            generated_text=tokenizer.decode(\n                output[0][input_len:], skip_special_tokens=True\n            ),\n        )\n        input = {\n            ''input_ids'': output,\n            ''attention_mask'': torch.ones(1, len(output[0])),\n        }\n```\n\n4. Serve and use:\n```python\n# Server\nwith Deployment(uses=TokenStreamingExecutor, port=12345, protocol=''grpc'') as dep:\n    dep.block()\n\n\n# Client\nasync def main():\n    client = Client(port=12345, protocol=''grpc'', asyncio=True)\n    async for doc in client.stream_doc(\n        on=''/stream'',\n        inputs=PromptDocument(prompt=''what is the capital of France ?'', max_tokens=10),\n        return_type=ModelOutputDocument,\n    ):\n        print(doc.generated_text)\n```\n\n## Support\n\nJina-serve is backed by [Jina AI](https://jina.ai) and licensed under [Apache-2.0](./LICENSE).\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":21798,"forks":2237,"watchers":21798,"open_issues":15,"topics":["cloud-native","cncf","deep-learning","docker","fastapi","framework","generative-ai","grpc","jaeger","kubernetes","llmops","machine-learning","microservice","mlops","multimodal","neural-search","opentelemetry","orchestration","pipeline","prometheus"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":1681072,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":true}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:jina-ai:jina","source_url":"https://github.com/jina-ai/jina"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:jina-ai:jina","source_url":"https://github.com/jina-ai/jina"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 65, '4fbc92e72eddf31562ee31f22f403f2f', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
