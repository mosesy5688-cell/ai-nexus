[Citation](#citation)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nFlan-UL2 is an encoder decoder model based on the `T5` architecture. It uses the same configuration as the [`UL2 model`](https://huggingface.co/google/ul2)  released earlier last year. It was fine tuned using the "Flan" prompt tuning \nand dataset collection.\n\nAccording to the original [blog](https://www.yitay.net/blog/flan-ul2-20b) here are the notable improvements:\n- The original UL2 model was only trained with receptive field of 512, which made it non-ideal for N-shot prompting where N is large. \n- The Flan-UL2 checkpoint uses a receptive field of 2048 which makes it more usable for few-shot in-context learning.\n- The original UL2 model also had mode switch tokens that was rather mandatory to get good performance. However, they were a little cumbersome as this requires often some changes during inference or finetuning. In this update/change, we continue training UL2 20B for an additional 100k steps (with small batch) to forget “mode tokens” before applying Flan instruction tuning. This Flan-UL2 checkpoint does not require mode tokens anymore.\n\n# Using the model \n\n## Converting from T5x to huggingface\n\nYou can use the [`convert_t5x_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/t5/convert_t5x_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py) script and pass the argument `strict = False`. The final layer norm is missing from the original dictionnary, that is why we are passing the `strict = False` argument.\n```bash\npython convert_t5x_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --t5x_checkpoint_path PATH_TO_T5X_CHECKPOINTS --config_file PATH_TO_CONFIG --pytorch_dump_path PATH_TO_SAVE\n```\nWe used the same config file as [`google/ul2`](https://huggingface.co/google/ul2/blob/main/config.json).\n\n## Running the model\n\nFor more efficient memory usage, we advise you to load the model in `8bit` using `load_in_8bit` flag as follows (works only under GPU):\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate transformers bitsandbytes\nfrom transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-ul2", device_map="auto", load_in_8bit=True)                                                                 \ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-ul2")\n\ninput_string = "Answer the following question by reasoning step by step. The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 for lunch, and bought 6 more, how many apple do they have?"                                               \n\ninputs = tokenizer(input_string, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=200)\n\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n# <pad> They have 23 - 20 = 3 apples left. They have 3 + 6 = 9 apples. Therefore, the answer is 9.</s>\n```\n\nOtherwise, you can load and run the model in `bfloat16` as follows:\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate transformers\nfrom transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-ul2", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")                                                                 \ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-ul2")\n\ninput_string = "Answer the following question by reasoning step by step. The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 for lunch, and bought 6 more, how many apple do they have?"                                               \n\ninputs = tokenizer(input_string, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=200)\n\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n# <pad> They have 23 - 20 = 3 apples left. They have 3 + 6 = 9 apples. Therefore, the answer is 9.</s>\n```\n\n# Results\n\n## Performance improvment \n\nThe reported results are the following : \n|  | MMLU | BBH | MMLU-CoT | BBH-CoT | Avg |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| FLAN-PaLM 62B | 59.6 | 47.5 | 56.9 | 44.9 | 49.9 |\n| FLAN-PaLM 540B | 73.5 | 57.9 | 70.9 | 66.3 | 67.2 |\n| FLAN-T5-XXL 11B | 55.1 | 45.3 | 48.6 | 41.4 | 47.6 |\n| FLAN-UL2 20B | 55.7(+1.1%) | 45.9(+1.3%) | 52.2(+7.4%) | 42.7(+3.1%) | 49.1(+3.2%) |\n\n\n# Introduction to UL2\n\nThis entire section has been copied from the [`google/ul2`](https://huggingface.co/google/ul2) model card and might be subject of change with respect to `flan-ul2`.\n\nUL2 is a unified framework for pretraining models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. UL2 uses Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), apre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. UL2 introduces a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes.\n\n![model image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research/google-research/master/ul2/figs/ul2.png)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nExisting pre-trained models are generally geared towards a particular class of problems. To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization. \n\nFor more information, please take a look at the original paper.\n\nPaper: [Unifying Language Learning Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05131v1)\n\nAuthors: *Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Vinh Q. Tran, Xavier Garcia, Dara Bahri, Tal Schuster, Huaixiu Steven Zheng, Neil Houlsby, Donald Metzler* \n\n\n## Training\n\n### Flan UL2\nThe Flan-UL2 model was initialized using the `UL2` checkpoints, and was then trained additionally using Flan Prompting. This means that the original training corpus is `C4`, \n\nIn “Scaling Instruction-Finetuned language models (Chung et al.)” (also referred to sometimes as the Flan2 paper), the key idea is to train a large language model on a collection of datasets. These datasets are phrased as instructions which enable generalization across diverse tasks. Flan has been primarily trained on academic tasks. In Flan2, we released a series of T5 models ranging from 200M to 11B parameters that have been instruction tuned with Flan.\n\nThe Flan datasets have also been open sourced in “The Flan Collection: Designing Data and Methods for Effective Instruction Tuning” (Longpre et al.). See Google AI Blogpost: “The Flan Collection: Advancing Open Source Methods for Instruction Tuning”. \n\n## UL2 PreTraining\n\nThe model is pretrained on the C4 corpus. For pretraining, the model is trained on a total of 1 trillion tokens on C4 (2 million steps)\nwith a batch size of 1024. The sequence length is set to 512/512 for inputs and targets. \nDropout is set to 0 during pretraining. Pre-training took slightly more than one month for about 1 trillion\ntokens. The model has 32 encoder layers and 32 decoder layers, `dmodel` of 4096 and `df` of 16384. \nThe dimension of each head is 256 for a total of 16 heads. Our model uses a model parallelism of 8. \nThe same sentencepiece tokenizer as T5 of vocab size 32000 is used (click [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.0/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.T5Tokenizer) for more information about the T5 tokenizer).\n\nUL-20B can be interpreted as a model that is quite similar to T5 but trained with a different objective and slightly different scaling knobs. \nUL-20B was trained using the [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and [T5X](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) infrastructure.\n\nThe training objective during pretraining is a mixture of different denoising strategies that are explained in the following:\n\n### Mixture of Denoisers\n\nTo quote the paper:\n> We conjecture that a strong universal model has to be exposed to solving diverse set of problems\n> during pre-training. Given that pre-training is done using self-supervision, we argue that such diversity\n> should be injected to the objective of the model, otherwise the model might suffer from lack a certain\n> ability, like long-coherent text generation.\n> Motivated by this, as well as current class of objective functions, we define three main paradigms that\n> are used during pre-training:\n\n- **R-Denoiser**: The regular denoising is the standard span corruption introduced in [T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.0/en/model_doc/t5)\n that uses a range of 2 to 5 tokens as the span length, which masks about 15% of\ninput tokens. These spans are short and potentially useful to acquire knowledge instead of\nlearning to generate fluent text.\n\n- **S-Denoiser**: A specific case of denoising where we observe a strict sequential order when\nframing the inputs-to-targets task, i.e., prefix language modeling. To do so, we simply\npartition the input sequence into two sub-sequences of tokens as context and target such that\nthe targets do not rely on future information. This is unlike standard span corruption where\nthere could be a target token with earlier position than a context token. Note that similar to\nthe Prefix-LM setup, the context (prefix) retains a bidirectional receptive field. We note that\nS-Denoising with very short memory or no memory is in similar spirit to standard causal\nlanguage modeling.\n\n- **X-Denoiser**: An extreme version of denoising where the model must recover a large part\nof the input, given a small to moderate part of it. This simulates a situation where a model\nneeds to generate long target from a memory with relatively limited information. To do\nso, we opt to include examples with aggressive denoising where approximately 50% of the\ninput sequence is masked. This is by increasing the span length and/or corruption rate. We\nconsider a pre-training task to be extreme if it has a long span (e.g., ≥ 12 tokens) or have\na large corruption rate (e.g., ≥ 30%). X-denoising is motivated by being an interpolation\nbetween regular span corruption and language model like objectives.\n\nSee the following diagram for a more visual explanation:\n\n![mixture-of-denoisers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research/google-research/master/ul2/figs/mod.png)\n\n**Important**: For more details, please see sections 3.1.2 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131v1.pdf).\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nThe model was continously fine-tuned after N pretraining steps where N is typically from 50k to 100k.\nIn other words, after each Nk steps of pretraining, the model is finetuned on each downstream task. See section 5.2.2 of [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131v1.pdf) to get an overview of all datasets that were used for fine-tuning).\n\nAs the model is continuously finetuned, finetuning is stopped on a task once it has reached state-of-the-art to save compute.\nIn total, the model was trained for 2.65 million steps.\n\n**Important**: For more details, please see sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131v1.pdf).\n\n# Contribution\n\nThis model was originally contributed by [Yi Tay](https://www.yitay.net/?author=636616684c5e64780328eece), and added to the Hugging Face ecosystem by [Younes Belkada](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada) & [Arthur Zucker](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ).\n\n# Citation\n\nIf you want to cite this work, please consider citing the [blogpost](https://www.yitay.net/blog/flan-ul2-20b) announcing the release of `Flan-UL2`.', '{"pipeline_tag":null,"library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":null,"storage_bytes":161423361013,"files_count":17,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["T5ForConditionalGeneration"],"model_type":"t5","tokenizer_config":{"eos_token":"</s>","pad_token":"<pad>","unk_token":"<unk>"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google:jax","source_url":"https://github.com/google/jax"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:t5x","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/t5x"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2205.05131","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05131"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 77.5, 'ec3fec8020f497a03dca297c8ce88d9a', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

This model is case sensitive: it makes a difference\nbetween english and English.\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing BERT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by\nthe Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nBERT is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of multilingual data in a self-supervised fashion. This means\nit was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it\nwas pretrained with two objectives:\n\n- Masked language modeling (MLM): taking a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run\n  the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional\n  recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like\n  GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the\n  sentence.\n- Next sentence prediction (NSP): the models concatenates two masked sentences as inputs during pretraining. Sometimes\n  they correspond to sentences that were next to each other in the original text, sometimes not. The model then has to\n  predict if the two sentences were following each other or not.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the languages in the training set that can then be used to\nextract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a\nstandard classifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it''s mostly intended to\nbe fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=bert) to look for\nfine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)\nto make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text\ngeneration you should look at model like GPT2.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline(''fill-mask'', model=''bert-base-multilingual-cased'')\n>>> unmasker("Hello I''m a [MASK] model.")\n\n[{''sequence'': "[CLS] Hello I''m a model model.

[SEP]",\n  ''score'': 0.020079681649804115,\n  ''token'': 14155,\n  ''token_str'': ''business''}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(''bert-base-multilingual-cased'')\nmodel = BertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-multilingual-cased")\ntext = "Replace me by any text you''d like."\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=''pt'')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertModel\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(''bert-base-multilingual-cased'')\nmodel = TFBertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-multilingual-cased")\ntext = "Replace me by any text you''d like."\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=''tf'')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n## Training data\n\nThe BERT model was pretrained on the 104 languages with the largest Wikipedias. You can find the complete list\n[here](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md#list-of-languages).\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are lowercased and tokenized using WordPiece and a shared vocabulary size of 110,000. The languages with a\nlarger Wikipedia are under-sampled and the ones with lower resources are oversampled. For languages like Chinese,\nJapanese Kanji and Korean Hanja that don''t have space, a CJK Unicode block is added around every character. \n\nThe inputs of the model are then of the form:\n\n```\n[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]\n```\n\nWith probability 0.5, sentence A and sentence B correspond to two consecutive sentences in the original corpus and in\nthe other cases, it''s another random sentence in the corpus. Note that what is considered a sentence here is a\nconsecutive span of text usually longer than a single sentence. The only constrain is that the result with the two\n"sentences" has a combined length of less than 512 tokens.\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n- 15% of the tokens are masked.\n- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `[MASK]`.\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805,\n  author    = {Jacob Devlin and\n               Ming{-}Wei Chang and\n               Kenton Lee and\n               Kristina Toutanova},\n  title     = {{BERT:} Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language\n               Understanding},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1810.04805},\n  year      = {2018},\n  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {1810.04805},\n  timestamp = {Tue, 30 Oct 2018 20:39:56 +0100},\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-1810-04805.bib},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"fill-mask","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":178566653,"storage_bytes":14492059671,"files_count":10,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["BertForMaskedLM"],"model_type":"bert","tokenizer_config":{}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:bert","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/bert"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:bert","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/bert"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:1810.04805","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 62.5, '6b23b22ffb24663661b86ea6d8aa9d82', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Therefore, we recommend enabling prompt extension. We provide the following two methods for prompt extension:\n\n- Use the Dashscope API for extension.\n  - Apply for a `dashscope.api_key` in advance ([EN](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/getting-started/first-api-call-to-qwen) | [CN](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/first-api-call-to-qwen)).\n  - Configure the environment variable `DASH_API_KEY` to specify the Dashscope API key. For users of Alibaba Cloud''s international site, you also need to set the environment variable `DASH_API_URL` to ''https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v1''. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [dashscope document](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/developer-reference/use-qwen-by-calling-api?spm=a2c63.p38356.0.i1).\n  - Use the `qwen-plus` model for text-to-video tasks and `qwen-vl-max` for image-to-video tasks.\n  - You can modify the model used for extension with the parameter `--prompt_extend_model`. For example:\n```sh\nDASH_API_KEY=your_key torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --lora_dir ./Wan2.2-Lightning/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-4steps-lora-rank64-Seko-V1 --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage" --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method ''dashscope'' --prompt_extend_target_lang ''zh''\n```\n\n- Using a local model for extension.\n\n  - By default, the Qwen model on HuggingFace is used for this extension. Users can choose Qwen models or other models based on the available GPU memory size.\n  - For text-to-video tasks, you can use models like `Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` and `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`.\n  - For image-to-video tasks, you can use models like `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` and `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct`.\n  - Larger models generally provide better extension results but require more GPU memory.\n  - You can modify the model used for extension with the parameter `--prompt_extend_model` , allowing you to specify either a local model path or a Hugging Face model. For example:\n\n``` sh\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --lora_dir ./Wan2.2-Lightning/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-4steps-lora-rank64-Seko-V1 --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage" --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method ''local_qwen'' --prompt_extend_target_lang ''zh''\n```\n\n\n#### Run Image-to-Video Generation\n\nThis repository supports the `Wan2.2-I2V-A14B` Image-to-Video model and can simultaneously support video generation at 480P and 720P resolutions.\n\n\n- Single-GPU inference\n```sh\npython generate.py  --task i2v-A14B  --size "1280*720" --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --lora_dir ./Wan2.2-Lightning/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-4steps-lora-rank64-Seko-V1 --offload_model True --base_seed 42 --prompt_file examples/i2v_prompt_list.txt --image_path_file examples/i2v_image_path_list.txt\n```\n\n> This command can run on a GPU with at least 80GB VRAM.\n\n> 💡For the Image-to-Video task, the `size` parameter represents the area of the generated video, with the aspect ratio following that of the original input image.\n\n\n- Multi-GPU inference using FSDP + DeepSpeed Ulysses\n\n```sh\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --lora_dir ./Wan2.2-Lightning/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-4steps-lora-rank64-Seko-V1 --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --base_seed 42 --prompt_file examples/i2v_prompt_list.txt --image_path_file examples/i2v_image_path_list.txt\n```\n\n<!-- \n- Image-to-Video Generation without prompt\n\n```sh\nDASH_API_KEY=your_key torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --prompt '''' --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method ''dashscope''\n```\n\n> 💡The model can generate videos solely from the input image. You can use prompt extension to generate prompt from the image.\n\n> The process of prompt extension can be referenced [here](#2-using-prompt-extention).\n\n#### Run Text-Image-to-Video Generation\n\nThis repository supports the `Wan2.2-TI2V-5B` Text-Image-to-Video model and can support video generation at 720P resolutions.\n\n\n- Single-GPU Text-to-Video inference\n```sh\npython generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size 1280*704 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --t5_cpu --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage"\n```\n\n> 💡Unlike other tasks, the 720P resolution of the Text-Image-to-Video task is `1280*704` or `704*1280`.\n\n> This command can run on a GPU with at least 24GB VRAM (e.g, RTX 4090 GPU).\n\n> 💡If you are running on a GPU with at least 80GB VRAM, you can remove the `--offload_model True`, `--convert_model_dtype` and `--t5_cpu` options to speed up execution.\n\n\n- Single-GPU Image-to-Video inference\n```sh\npython generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size 1280*704 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --t5_cpu --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard. The fluffy-furred feline gazes directly at the camera with a relaxed expression. Blurred beach scenery forms the background featuring crystal-clear waters, distant green hills, and a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The cat assumes a naturally relaxed posture, as if savoring the sea breeze and warm sunlight. A close-up shot highlights the feline''s intricate details and the refreshing atmosphere of the seaside."\n```\n\n> 💡If the image parameter is configured, it is an Image-to-Video generation; otherwise, it defaults to a Text-to-Video generation.\n\n> 💡Similar to Image-to-Video, the `size` parameter represents the area of the generated video, with the aspect ratio following that of the original input image.\n\n\n- Multi-GPU inference using FSDP + DeepSpeed Ulysses\n\n```sh\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size 1280*704 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard.

Stay tuned for our forthcoming code and paper, which will provide more details on the whole process.\n\nStarling-LM-7B-alpha is a language model trained from [Openchat 3.5](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat_3.5) with reward model [berkeley-nest/Starling-RM-7B-alpha](https://huggingface.co/berkeley-nest/Starling-RM-7B-alpha) and policy optimization method [advantage-induced policy alignment (APA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02231).

You can convert it using the following code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nimage = Image.open(...)\n\nif image.mode != "RGB":\n    image = image.convert("RGB")\n```\n\n### Molmo doesn''t work great with transparent images!\n\nWe received reports that Molmo models might struggle with transparent images. \nFor the time being, we recommend adding a white or dark background to your images before passing them to the model. The code snippet below shows how to do this using the Python Imaging Library (PIL):\n\n```python\n\n# Load the image\nurl = "..."\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\n# Convert the image to grayscale to calculate brightness\ngray_image = image.convert(''L'')  # Convert to grayscale\n\n# Calculate the average brightness\nstat = ImageStat.Stat(gray_image)\naverage_brightness = stat.mean[0]  # Get the average value\n\n# Define background color based on brightness (threshold can be adjusted)\nbg_color = (0, 0, 0) if average_brightness > 127 else (255, 255, 255)\n\n# Create a new image with the same size as the original, filled with the background color\nnew_image = Image.new(''RGB'', image.size, bg_color)\n\n# Paste the original image on top of the background (use image as a mask if needed)\nnew_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image if image.mode == ''RGBA'' else None)\n\n# Now you can pass the new_image to Molmo\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\n    ''allenai/Molmo-7B-D-0924'',\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n    torch_dtype=''auto'',\n    device_map=''auto''\n)\n```\n\n## License and Use\n\nThis model is licensed under Apache 2.0.

Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 is developed using an improved training recipe from [ChatQA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10225), and it is built on top of [Llama-3 base model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B). Specifically, we incorporate more conversational QA data to enhance its tabular and arithmetic calculation capability. Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 has two variants: Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-8B and Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B. Both models were originally trained using [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM), we converted the checkpoints to Hugging Face format. **For more information about ChatQA, check the [website](https://chatqa-project.github.io/)!**\n\n## Other Resources\n[Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B) &ensp; [Evaluation Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/ChatRAG-Bench) &ensp; [Training Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/ChatQA-Training-Data) &ensp; [Retriever](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/dragon-multiturn-query-encoder) &ensp; [Website](https://chatqa-project.github.io/) &ensp; [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10225)\n\n## Benchmark Results\nResults in [ChatRAG Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/ChatRAG-Bench) are as follows:\n\n| | ChatQA-1.0-7B | Command-R-Plus | Llama3-instruct-70b | GPT-4-0613 | GPT-4-Turbo | ChatQA-1.0-70B | ChatQA-1.5-8B | ChatQA-1.5-70B |\n| -- |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| Doc2Dial | 37.88 | 33.51 | 37.88 | 34.16 | 35.35 | 38.90 | 39.33 | 41.26 |\n| QuAC | 29.69 | 34.16 | 36.96 | 40.29 | 40.10 | 41.82 | 39.73 | 38.82 |\n| QReCC | 46.97 | 49.77 | 51.34 | 52.01 | 51.46 | 48.05 | 49.03 | 51.40 |\n| CoQA | 76.61 | 69.71 | 76.98 | 77.42 | 77.73 | 78.57 | 76.46 | 78.44 |\n| DoQA | 41.57 | 40.67 | 41.24 | 43.39 | 41.60 | 51.94 | 49.60 | 50.67 |\n| ConvFinQA | 51.61 | 71.21 | 76.6 | 81.28 | 84.16 | 73.69 | 78.46 | 81.88 |\n| SQA | 61.87 | 74.07 | 69.61 | 79.21 | 79.98 | 69.14 | 73.28 | 83.82 |\n| TopioCQA | 45.45 | 53.77 | 49.72 | 45.09 | 48.32 | 50.98 | 49.96 | 55.63 |\n| HybriDial* | 54.51 | 46.7 | 48.59 | 49.81 | 47.86 | 56.44 | 65.76 | 68.27 |\n| INSCIT | 30.96 | 35.76 | 36.23 | 36.34 | 33.75 | 31.90 | 30.10 | 32.31 |\n| Average (all) | 47.71 | 50.93 | 52.52 | 53.90 | 54.03 | 54.14 | 55.17 | 58.25 |\n| Average (exclude HybriDial) | 46.96 | 51.40 | 52.95 | 54.35 | 54.72 | 53.89 | 53.99 | 57.14 |\n\nNote that ChatQA-1.5 is built based on Llama-3 base model, and ChatQA-1.0 is built based on Llama-2 base model.

Introduction of Deepseek Coder\n\nDeepseek Coder is composed of a series of code language models, each trained from scratch on 2T tokens, with a composition of 87% code and 13% natural language in both English and Chinese. We provide various sizes of the code model, ranging from 1B to 33B versions. Each model is pre-trained on project-level code corpus by employing a window size of 16K and a extra fill-in-the-blank task, to support  project-level code completion and infilling. For coding capabilities, Deepseek Coder achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models on multiple programming languages and various benchmarks. \n\n- **Massive Training Data**: Trained from scratch on 2T tokens, including 87% code and 13% linguistic data in both English and Chinese languages.\n  \n- **Highly Flexible & Scalable**: Offered in model sizes of 1.3B, 5.7B, 6.7B, and 33B, enabling users to choose the setup most suitable for their requirements.\n  \n- **Superior Model Performance**: State-of-the-art performance among publicly available code models on HumanEval, MultiPL-E, MBPP, DS-1000, and APPS benchmarks.\n  \n- **Advanced Code Completion Capabilities**: A window size of 16K and a fill-in-the-blank task, supporting project-level code completion and infilling tasks.\n\n \n  \n### 2. Model Summary\ndeepseek-coder-33b-instruct is a 33B parameter model initialized from deepseek-coder-33b-base and fine-tuned on 2B tokens of instruction data.\n- **Home Page:** [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com/)\n- **Repository:** [deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder)\n- **Chat With DeepSeek Coder:** [DeepSeek-Coder](https://coder.deepseek.com/)\n\n\n### 3. How to Use\nHere give some examples of how to use our model.\n#### Chat Model Inference\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct", trust_remote_code=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).cuda()\nmessages=[\n    { ''role'': ''user'', ''content'': "write a quick sort algorithm in python."}\n]\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n# tokenizer.eos_token_id is the id of <|EOT|> token\noutputs = model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=512, do_sample=False, top_k=50, top_p=0.95, num_return_sequences=1, eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][len(inputs[0]):], skip_special_tokens=True))\n```\n\n### 4.

It can generate a 5-second 480P video on an RTX 4090 in about 4 minutes (without optimization techniques like quantization). Its performance is even comparable to some closed-source models.\n- 👍 **Multiple Tasks**: **Wan2.1** excels in Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video Editing, Text-to-Image, and Video-to-Audio, advancing the field of video generation.\n- 👍 **Visual Text Generation**: **Wan2.1** is the first video model capable of generating both Chinese and English text, featuring robust text generation that enhances its practical applications.\n- 👍 **Powerful Video VAE**: **Wan-VAE** delivers exceptional efficiency and performance, encoding and decoding 1080P videos of any length while preserving temporal information, making it an ideal foundation for video and image generation.\n\n\nThis repository contains our I2V-14B model, which is capable of generating 720P high-definition videos. After thousands of rounds of human evaluations, this model has outperformed both closed-source and open-source alternatives, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\n\n## Video Demos\n\n<div align="center">\n    <video width="80%" controls>\n        <source src="https://cloud.video.taobao.com/vod/Jth64Y7wNoPcJki_Bo1ZJTDBvNjsgjlVKsNs05Fqfps.mp4" type="video/mp4">\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n</div>\n\n## 🔥 Latest News!!\n\n* Feb 25, 2025: 👋 We''ve released the inference code and weights of Wan2.1.\n\n\n## 📑 Todo List\n- Wan2.1 Text-to-Video\n    - [x] Multi-GPU Inference code of the 14B and 1.3B models\n    - [x] Checkpoints of the 14B and 1.3B models\n    - [x] Gradio demo\n    - [ ] Diffusers integration\n    - [ ] ComfyUI integration\n- Wan2.1 Image-to-Video\n    - [x] Multi-GPU Inference code of the 14B model\n    - [x] Checkpoints of the 14B model\n    - [x] Gradio demo\n    - [ ] Diffusers integration\n    - [ ] ComfyUI integration\n\n\n## Quickstart\n\n#### Installation\nClone the repo:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1.git\ncd Wan2.1\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n```\n# Ensure torch >= 2.4.0\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n\n#### Model Download\n\n| Models        |                       Download Link                                           |    Notes                      |\n| --------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| T2V-14B       |      🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B)      🤖 [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B)          | Supports both 480P and 720P\n| I2V-14B-720P  |      🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-720P)    🤖 [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-720P)     | Supports 720P\n| I2V-14B-480P  |      🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P)    🤖 [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P)      | Supports 480P\n| T2V-1.3B      |      🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B)     🤖 [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B)         | Supports 480P\n\n> 💡Note: The 1.3B model is capable of generating videos at 720P resolution.

The results clearly indicate that **Wan2.1** outperforms both closed-source and open-source models.\n\n<div align="center">\n    <img src="assets/i2v_res.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;" />\n</div>\n\n\n## Computational Efficiency on Different GPUs\n\nWe test the computational efficiency of different **Wan2.1** models on different GPUs in the following table. The results are presented in the format: **Total time (s) / peak GPU memory (GB)**.\n\n\n<div align="center">\n    <img src="assets/comp_effic.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;" />\n</div>\n\n> The parameter settings for the tests presented in this table are as follows:\n> (1) For the 1.3B model on 8 GPUs, set `--ring_size 8` and `--ulysses_size 1`;\n> (2) For the 14B model on 1 GPU, use `--offload_model True`;\n> (3) For the 1.3B model on a single 4090 GPU, set `--offload_model True --t5_cpu`;\n> (4) For all testings, no prompt extension was applied, meaning `--use_prompt_extend` was not enabled.\n\n-------\n\n## Introduction of Wan2.1\n\n**Wan2.1**  is designed on the mainstream diffusion transformer paradigm, achieving significant advancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations. These include our novel spatio-temporal variational autoencoder (VAE), scalable training strategies, large-scale data construction, and automated evaluation metrics. Collectively, these contributions enhance the model’s performance and versatility.\n\n\n##### (1) 3D Variational Autoencoders\nWe propose a novel 3D causal VAE architecture, termed **Wan-VAE** specifically designed for video generation. By combining multiple strategies, we improve spatio-temporal compression, reduce memory usage, and ensure temporal causality. **Wan-VAE** demonstrates significant advantages in performance efficiency compared to other open-source VAEs. Furthermore, our **Wan-VAE** can encode and decode unlimited-length 1080P videos without losing historical temporal information, making it particularly well-suited for video generation tasks.\n\n\n<div align="center">\n    <img src="assets/video_vae_res.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%;" />\n</div>\n\n\n##### (2) Video Diffusion DiT\n\n**Wan2.1** is designed using the Flow Matching framework within the paradigm of mainstream Diffusion Transformers. Our model''s architecture uses the T5 Encoder to encode multilingual text input, with cross-attention in each transformer block embedding the text into the model structure. Additionally, we employ an MLP with a Linear layer and a SiLU layer to process the input time embeddings and predict six modulation parameters individually. This MLP is shared across all transformer blocks, with each block learning a distinct set of biases. Our experimental findings reveal a significant performance improvement with this approach at the same parameter scale.\n\n<div align="center">\n    <img src="assets/video_dit_arch.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%;" />\n</div>\n\n\n| Model  | Dimension | Input Dimension | Output Dimension | Feedforward Dimension | Frequency Dimension | Number of Heads | Number of Layers |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| 1.3B   | 1536      | 16              | 16               | 8960                  | 256                 | 12              | 30               |\n| 14B   | 5120       | 16              | 16               | 13824                 | 256                 | 40              | 40               |\n\n\n\n##### Data\n\nWe curated and deduplicated a candidate dataset comprising a vast amount of image and video data. During the data curation process, we designed a four-step data cleaning process, focusing on fundamental dimensions, visual quality and motion quality. Through the robust data processing pipeline, we can easily obtain high-quality, diverse, and large-scale training sets of images and videos.\n\n![figure1](assets/data_for_diff_stage.jpg "figure1")\n\n\n##### Comparisons to SOTA\nWe compared **Wan2.1** with leading open-source and closed-source models to evaluate the performace. Using our carefully designed set of 1,035 internal prompts, we tested across 14 major dimensions and 26 sub-dimensions. We then compute the total score by performing a weighted calculation on the scores of each dimension, utilizing weights derived from human preferences in the matching process. The detailed results are shown in the table below. These results demonstrate our model''s superior performance compared to both open-source and closed-source models.\n\n![figure1](assets/vben_vs_sota.png "figure1")\n\n\n## Citation\nIf you find our work helpful, please cite us.\n\n```\n@article{wan2.1,\n    title   = {Wan: Open and Advanced Large-Scale Video Generative Models},\n    author  = {Wan Team},\n    journal = {},\n    year    = {2025}\n}\n```\n\n## License Agreement\nThe models in this repository are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

The metrics can be found below and show that the model has significantly improved performance from Mistral-7B-v0.1 and neural-chat-7b-v3.\n\n| Model | Average ⬆️| ARC (25-s) ⬆️ | HellaSwag (10-s) ⬆️ | MMLU (5-s) ⬆️| TruthfulQA (MC) (0-s) ⬆️ | Winogrande (5-s) | GSM8K (5-s) | DROP (3-s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|[mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) | 50.32 | 59.58  | 83.31  | 64.16  | 42.15 | 78.37 | 18.12 | 6.14 |\n| [Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3](https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3) | **57.31** | 67.15 | 83.29 | 62.26  | 58.77 | 78.06 | 1.21 | 50.43 |\n| [Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1](https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1) | **59.06** | 66.21 | 83.64 | 62.37  | 59.65 | 78.14 | 19.56 | 43.84 |\n\n## Testing Model Quantizability\nThe following code block can be run to determine, for PyTorch models, if that model is amenable to quantization.  \nOne caveat - the Intel Extension for PyTorch uses optimum ipex, which is pre-release and needs further testing.\n\nTo install the dependencies, you should first install Intel Extensions for PyTorch and tehn pip install each of the following dependencies:\n- torch\n- optimum.intel\n- optimum[ipex]\n- transformers\n\n### Intel Extension for PyTorch method:\nIn this case, we are testing if neural-chat-7b-v3-1 can be quantized and this testing method demonstrates the model size change, for example:\nwhen the base type is specified to be torch.bfloat16 but also specifying that load_in_4bit=True which causes the weights only to be quantized we see an output from the model testing as follows:\n- **model_quantize_internal: model size  = 27625.02 MB**\n- **model_quantize_internal: quant size  =  4330.80 MB**\n\nThis code should run from within a python script - such as ipex_test.py as follows:\n```python\nimport torch\nimport os\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nfrom intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline\nmodel_name = "Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1"     \nprompt = "Once upon a time, there existed a little girl,"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids\n\nresult = {torch.bfloat16:"failed"}\ntyp = torch.bfloat16\ntry:\n    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, load_in_4bit=True,  torch_dtype = typ)\n    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=20)\n    result[typ] = f"passed, {os.stat(model.bin_file).st_size}"\nexcept:\n    result[typ] = "failed"\n\n    \nprint("\n\nResults of quantizing: ")  \n# determine if Quantized\nwith open(r"output.log", ''r'') as fp:\n    for l_no, line in enumerate(fp):\n        # search string\n        if ''model_quantize_internal'' in line:\n            print(line)\n            \nprint("\n\nExecution results ")\nfor k,v in result.items():\n    print(k,v)\n    \nprint("\n\nModel Output: ")\ntokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True).strip()\n```\nRun the code as folows from a bash terminal:\n```bash\npython ipex_test.py 2>&1 | tee output.log\n```\nThe entire output is captured in the output.log but it will be summarized, \nalong with output from the model indicating either pass or fail of the quantization as well as model output for a given prompt.\n\n\n## Ethical Considerations and Limitations\nNeural-chat-7b-v3-1 can produce factually incorrect output, and should not be relied on to produce factually accurate information. Because of the limitations of the pretrained model and the finetuning datasets, it is possible that this model could generate lewd, biased or otherwise offensive outputs.\n\nTherefore, before deploying any applications of neural-chat-7b-v3-1, developers should perform safety testing.\n\n## Caveats and Recommendations\n\nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\nHere are a couple of useful links to learn more about Intel''s AI software:\n* Intel Neural Compressor [link](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor)\n* Intel Extension for Transformers [link](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe license on this model does not constitute legal advice.

Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:  \n+ Quality of Service: the Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.   \n+ Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. \n+ Inappropriate or Offensive Content: these models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. \n+ Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.  \n+ Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.   \n\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include: \n+ Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\n+ High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context. \n+ Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).   \n+ Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case. \n+ Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\n\n\n## Training\n\n### Model\n\n* Architecture: Phi-3 Mini has 3.8B parameters and is a dense decoder-only Transformer model.

This is only a test.\n\nIf this were a real emergency, you would be told what to do.\n\nThis is a test\n=====================\nThis is another test of the new blogging software.

We''re looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to\nmake the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs.\n\n## The Mistral AI Team\n\nAlbert Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Alexis Tacnet, Antoine Roux, Arthur Mensch, Audrey Herblin-Stoop, Baptiste Bout, Baudouin de Monicault, Blanche Savary, Bam4d, Caroline Feldman, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Eleonore Arcelin, Emma Bou Hanna, Etienne Metzger, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Bour, Guillaume Lample, Harizo Rajaona, Jean-Malo Delignon, Jia Li, Justus Murke, Louis Martin, Louis Ternon, Lucile Saulnier, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Margaret Jennings, Marie Pellat, Marie Torelli, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Nicolas Schuhl, Patrick von Platen, Pierre Stock, Sandeep Subramanian, Sophia Yang, Szymon Antoniak, Teven Le Scao, Thibaut Lavril, Timothée Lacroix, Théophile Gervet, Thomas Wang, Valera Nemychnikova, William El Sayed, William Marshall', '{"pipeline_tag":null,"library_name":"vllm","framework":"vllm","params":7248023552,"storage_bytes":28992746844,"files_count":15,"spaces_count":92,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["MistralForCausalLM"],"model_type":"mistral","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"<s>","eos_token":"</s>","pad_token":null,"unk_token":"<unk>","use_default_system_prompt":false}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:mistralai:mistral-inference","source_url":"https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 62.4, 'c4cd79cb63281edec23e4a2210fa5d0d', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

[nomic-embed-vision-v1](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-vision-v1) is aligned to the embedding space of `nomic-embed-text-v1`, meaning any text embedding is multimodal!\n\n## Usage\n\n**Important**: the text prompt *must* include a *task instruction prefix*, instructing the model which task is being performed. \n\nFor example, if you are implementing a RAG application, you embed your documents as `search_document: <text here>` and embed your user queries as `search_query: <text here>`.\n\n## Task instruction prefixes\n\n### `search_document`\n\n#### Purpose: embed texts as documents from a dataset\n\nThis prefix is used for embedding texts as documents, for example as documents for a RAG index.\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1", trust_remote_code=True)\nsentences = [''search_document: TSNE is a dimensionality reduction algorithm created by Laurens van Der Maaten'']\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n### `search_query`\n\n#### Purpose: embed texts as questions to answer\n\nThis prefix is used for embedding texts as questions that documents from a dataset could resolve, for example as queries to be answered by a RAG application.\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1", trust_remote_code=True)\nsentences = [''search_query: Who is Laurens van Der Maaten?'']\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n### `clustering`\n\n#### Purpose: embed texts to group them into clusters\n\nThis prefix is used for embedding texts in order to group them into clusters, discover common topics, or remove semantic duplicates.\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1", trust_remote_code=True)\nsentences = [''clustering: the quick brown fox'']\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n### `classification`\n\n#### Purpose: embed texts to classify them\n\nThis prefix is used for embedding texts into vectors that will be used as features for a classification model\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1", trust_remote_code=True)\nsentences = [''classification: the quick brown fox'']\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n### Sentence Transformers\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1", trust_remote_code=True)\nsentences = [''search_query: What is TSNE?'', ''search_query: Who is Laurens van der Maaten?'']\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n### Transformers\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n\ndef mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):\n    token_embeddings = model_output[0]\n    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()\n    return torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)\n\nsentences = [''search_query: What is TSNE?'', ''search_query: Who is Laurens van der Maaten?'']\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(''bert-base-uncased'')\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(''nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1'', trust_remote_code=True)\nmodel.eval()\n\nencoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=''pt'')\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    model_output = model(**encoded_input)\n\nembeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input[''attention_mask''])\nembeddings = F.normalize(embeddings, p=2, dim=1)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\nThe model natively supports scaling of the sequence length past 2048 tokens. To do so, \n\n```diff\n- tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(''bert-base-uncased'')\n+ tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(''bert-base-uncased'', model_max_length=8192)\n\n\n- model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(''nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1'', trust_remote_code=True)\n+ model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(''nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1'', trust_remote_code=True, rotary_scaling_factor=2)\n```\n\n### Transformers.js\n\n```js\nimport { pipeline } from ''@xenova/transformers'';\n\n// Create a feature extraction pipeline\nconst extractor = await pipeline(''feature-extraction'', ''nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1'', {\n    quantized: false, // Comment out this line to use the quantized version\n});\n\n// Compute sentence embeddings\nconst texts = [''search_query: What is TSNE?'', ''search_query: Who is Laurens van der Maaten?''];\nconst embeddings = await extractor(texts, { pooling: ''mean'', normalize: true });\nconsole.log(embeddings);\n```\n\n## Nomic API\n\nThe easiest way to get started with Nomic Embed is through the Nomic Embedding API.\n\nGenerating embeddings with the `nomic` Python client is as easy as \n\n```python\nfrom nomic import embed\n\noutput = embed.text(\n    texts=[''Nomic Embedding API'', ''#keepAIOpen''],\n    model=''nomic-embed-text-v1'',\n    task_type=''search_document''\n)\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nFor more information, see the [API reference](https://docs.nomic.ai/reference/endpoints/nomic-embed-text)\n\n\n## Training\nClick the Nomic Atlas map below to visualize a 5M sample of our contrastive pretraining data!\n\n[![image/webp](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/607997c83a565c15675055b3/pjhJhuNyRfPagRd_c_iUz.webp)](https://atlas.nomic.ai/map/nomic-text-embed-v1-5m-sample)\n\nWe train our embedder using a multi-stage training pipeline. Starting from a long-context [BERT model](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-bert-2048),\nthe first unsupervised contrastive stage trains on a dataset generated from weakly related text pairs, such as question-answer pairs from forums like StackExchange and Quora, title-body pairs from Amazon reviews, and summarizations from news articles.\n\nIn the second finetuning stage, higher quality labeled datasets such as search queries and answers from web searches are leveraged. Data curation and hard-example mining is crucial in this stage.\n\nFor more details, see the Nomic Embed [Technical Report](https://static.nomic.ai/reports/2024_Nomic_Embed_Text_Technical_Report.pdf) and corresponding [blog post](https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/nomic-embed-text-v1).\n\nTraining data to train the models is released in its entirety.

Our approach is built upon three key technical breakthroughs:\n\n1. **DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA):** We introduce DSA, an efficient attention mechanism that substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance, specifically optimized for long-context scenarios.\n2. **Scalable Reinforcement Learning Framework:** By implementing a robust RL protocol and scaling post-training compute, *DeepSeek-V3.2* performs comparably to GPT-5. Notably, our high-compute variant, **DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale**, **surpasses GPT-5** and exhibits reasoning proficiency on par with Gemini-3.0-Pro.\n    - *Achievement:* 🥇 **Gold-medal performance** in the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).\n3. **Large-Scale Agentic Task Synthesis Pipeline:** To integrate **reasoning into tool-use** scenarios, we developed a novel synthesis pipeline that systematically generates training data at scale. This facilitates scalable agentic post-training, improving compliance and generalization in complex interactive environments.\n\n<div align="center">\n <img src="assets/benchmark.png" >\n</div>\n\nWe have also released the final submissions for IOI 2025, ICPC World Finals, IMO 2025 and CMO 2025, which were selected based on our designed pipeline. These materials are provided for the community to conduct secondary verification. The files can be accessed at `assets/olympiad_cases`.\n\n## Chat Template\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 introduces significant updates to its chat template compared to prior versions. The primary changes involve a revised format for tool calling and the introduction of a "thinking with tools" capability.\n\nTo assist the community in understanding and adapting to this new template, we have provided a dedicated `encoding` folder, which contains Python scripts and test cases demonstrating how to encode messages in OpenAI-compatible format into input strings for the model and how to parse the model''s text output.\n\nA brief example is illustrated below:\n\n```python\nimport transformers\n# encoding/encoding_dsv32.py\nfrom encoding_dsv32 import encode_messages, parse_message_from_completion_text\n\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2")\n\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": "hello"},\n    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I am DeepSeek.", "reasoning_content": "thinking..."},\n    {"role": "user", "content": "1+1=?"}\n]\nencode_config = dict(thinking_mode="thinking", drop_thinking=True, add_default_bos_token=True)\n\n# messages -> string\nprompt = encode_messages(messages, **encode_config)\n# Output: "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>hello<｜Assistant｜></think>Hello! I am DeepSeek.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>1+1=?<｜Assistant｜><think>"\n\n# string -> tokens\ntokens = tokenizer.encode(prompt)\n# Output: [0, 128803, 33310, 128804, 128799, 19923, 3, 342, 1030, 22651, 4374, 1465, 16, 1, 128803, 19, 13, 19, 127252, 128804, 128798]\n```\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n1. This release does not include a Jinja-format chat template. Please refer to the Python code mentioned above.\n2. The output parsing function included in the code is designed to handle well-formatted strings only. It does not attempt to correct or recover from malformed output that the model might occasionally generate. It is not suitable for production use without robust error handling.\n3. A new role named `developer` has been introduced in the chat template. This role is dedicated exclusively to search agent scenarios and is designated for no other tasks. The official API does not accept messages assigned to `developer`.\n\n## How to Run Locally\n\nThe model structure of DeepSeek-V3.2 and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale are the same as DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. Please visit [DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp) repo for more information about running this model locally.\n\nUsage Recommendations:\n\n1. For local deployment, we recommend setting the sampling parameters to `temperature = 1.0, top_p = 0.95`.\n2. Please note that the DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale variant is designed exclusively for deep reasoning tasks and does not support the tool-calling functionality.\n\n## License\n\nThis repository and the model weights are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Citation\n\n```\n@misc{deepseekai2025deepseekv32,\n      title={DeepSeek-V3.2: Pushing the Frontier of Open Large Language Models}, \n      author={DeepSeek-AI},\n      year={2025},\n}\n```\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you have any questions, please raise an issue or contact us at [service@deepseek.com](service@deepseek.com).\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":685396921376,"storage_bytes":689484423011,"files_count":192,"spaces_count":0,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["DeepseekV32ForCausalLM"],"model_type":"deepseek_v32","quantization_config":{"quant_method":"fp8"},"tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>","lstrip":false,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false},"eos_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>","lstrip":false,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false},"pad_token":{"__type":"AddedToken","content":"<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>","lstrip":false,"normalized":true,"rstrip":false,"single_word":false},"unk_token":null}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:deepseek-ai:DeepSeek-V2","source_url":"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:deepseek-ai:DeepSeek-V2","source_url":"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:deepseek-ai:DeepSeek-V2","source_url":"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:deepseek-ai:DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp","source_url":"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 82.4, '3bcfd457e471fb9bcbb42b9df7e79361', NULL, 'https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale/resolve/main/assets/benchmark.png', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

result (**DDIM** kinda works too), CFG Scale 7, steps 20 should be fine\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nportrait of a girl in dgs illustration style, Anime girl, female soldier working in a cyberpunk city, cleavage, ((perfect femine face)), intricate, 8k, highly detailed, shy, digital painting, intense, sharp focus\n```\n\nFor cyber robot male character, you can add **muscular male** to improve the output.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\na photo of muscular beard soldier male in dgs illustration style, half-body, holding robot arms, strong chest\n```\n\n**Example 3 (with Stable Diffusion WebUI):**\n\nIf using [AUTOMATIC1111''s Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)\n\nYou can simply use this as **prompt** with **Euler A** Sampler,  CFG Scale 7, steps 20, 704 x 704px output res:\n\n```\nan anime girl in dgs illustration style\n```\n\nAnd set the **negative prompt** as this to get cleaner face: \n\n```\nout of focus, scary, creepy, evil, disfigured, missing limbs, ugly, gross, missing fingers\n```\n\nThis will give you the exactly same style as the sample images above.\n\n<center><img

It leverages the recently released FlashAttention-2 and a range of other optimizations to improve the speed and efficiency of inference and training.\n\n## Training and Fine-tuning\n\nThe model has been trained using a mixture of pre-training and instruction tuning data. \n- In the first training phase of continued pre-training, our data mixture contains 25% RedPajama Book, 25% RedPajama ArXiv (including abstracts), 25% other data from RedPajama, and 25% from the UL2 Oscar Data, which is a part of OIG (Open-Instruction-Generalist), asking the model to fill in missing chunks, or complete the text. \nTo enhance the long-context ability, we exclude data shorter than 2K word. The inclusion of UL2 Oscar Data is effective in compelling the model to read and utilize long-range context.\n- We then fine-tune the model to focus on its few shot capacity under long context, including 20% Natural Instructions (NI), 20% Public Pool of Prompts (P3), 20% the Pile. We decontaminated all data against HELM core scenarios . We teach the model to leverage the in-context examples by packing examples into one 32K-token sequence. To maintain the knowledge learned from the first piece of data, we incorporate 20% RedPajama-Data Book and 20% RedPajama-Data ArXiv.\n\nNext, we provide examples of how to fine-tune the model for specific applications. \nThe example datasets are placed in [togethercomputer/Long-Data-Collections](https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/Long-Data-Collections)\nYou can use the [OpenChatKit](https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit) to fine-tune your own 32K model over LLaMA-2-7B-32K.\nPlease refer to [OpenChatKit](https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit) for step-by-step illustrations.\n\n1. Long Context QA.\n\n   We take as an example the multi-document question answering task from the paper “Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts”. The input for the model consists of (i) a question that requires an answer and (ii) k documents, which are passages extracted from Wikipedia. Notably, only one of these documents contains the answer to the question, while the remaining k − 1 documents, termed as "distractor" documents, do not. To successfully perform this task, the model must identify and utilize the document containing the answer from its input context. \n\n   With OCK, simply run the following command to fine-tune:\n   ```\n   bash training/finetune_llama-2-7b-32k-mqa.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Summarization.\n\n   Another example is BookSum, a unique dataset designed to address the challenges of long-form narrative summarization. This dataset features source documents from the literature domain, including novels, plays, and stories, and offers human-written, highly abstractive summaries. We here focus on chapter-level data.  BookSum poses a unique set of challenges, necessitating that the model comprehensively read through each chapter.\n\n   With OCK, simply run the following command to fine-tune:\n   ```\n   bash training/finetune_llama-2-7b-32k-booksum.sh\n   ```\n\n\n## Inference\n\nYou can use the [Together API](https://together.ai/blog/api-announcement) to try out LLaMA-2-7B-32K for inference. \nThe updated inference stack allows for efficient inference.\n\nTo run the model locally, we strongly recommend to install Flash Attention V2, which is necessary to obtain the best performance:\n```\n# Please update the path of `CUDA_HOME`\nexport CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.8\npip install transformers==4.31.0\npip install sentencepiece\npip install ninja\npip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation\npip install git+https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention.git#subdirectory=csrc/rotary\n```\n\nYou can use this model directly from the Hugging Face Model Hub or fine-tune it on your own data using the OpenChatKit.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("togethercomputer/LLaMA-2-7B-32K")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("togethercomputer/LLaMA-2-7B-32K", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.float16)\n\ninput_context = "Your text here"\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_context, return_tensors="pt")\noutput = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=128, temperature=0.7)\noutput_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(output_text)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set `trust_remote_code=False` if you prefer not to use flash attention.\n\n\n## Limitations and Bias\n\nAs with all language models, LLaMA-2-7B-32K may generate incorrect or biased content. It''s important to keep this in mind when using the model.\n\n## Community\n\nJoin us on [Together Discord](https://discord.gg/6ZVDU8tTD4)', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":null,"storage_bytes":53908211130,"files_count":13,"spaces_count":82,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["LlamaForCausalLM"],"model_type":"llama","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"<s>","eos_token":"</s>","pad_token":"<unk>","unk_token":"<unk>","use_default_system_prompt":true}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:togethercomputer:OpenChatKit","source_url":"https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:togethercomputer:OpenChatKit","source_url":"https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:HazyResearch:flash-attention.git","source_url":"https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention.git#subdirectory=csrc"}]', NULL, 'LLaMA-2', 'approved', 62.3, 'a2c3da9226f9e227fb150c7a45a9ce80', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

It was introduced in\n[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) and first released in\n[this repository](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/roberta). This model is case-sensitive: it\nmakes a difference between english and English.\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing RoBERTa did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by\nthe Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nRoBERTa is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means\nit was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. \n\nMore precisely, it was pretrained with the Masked language modeling (MLM) objective. Taking a sentence, the model\nrandomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict\nthe masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one\nafter the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to\nlearn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a standard\nclassifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for masked language modeling, but it''s mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task.\nSee the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=roberta) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that\ninterests you.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)\nto make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text\ngeneration you should look at a model like GPT2.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline(''fill-mask'', model=''roberta-base'')\n>>> unmasker("Hello I''m a <mask> model.")\n\n[{''sequence'': "<s>Hello I''m a male model.</s>",\n  ''score'': 0.3306540250778198,\n  ''token'': 2943,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġmale''},\n {''sequence'': "<s>Hello I''m a female model.</s>",\n  ''score'': 0.04655390977859497,\n  ''token'': 2182,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġfemale''},\n {''sequence'': "<s>Hello I''m a professional model.</s>",\n  ''score'': 0.04232972860336304,\n  ''token'': 2038,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġprofessional''},\n {''sequence'': "<s>Hello I''m a fashion model.</s>",\n  ''score'': 0.037216778844594955,\n  ''token'': 2734,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġfashion''},\n {''sequence'': "<s>Hello I''m a Russian model.</s>",\n  ''score'': 0.03253649175167084,\n  ''token'': 1083,\n  ''token_str'': ''ĠRussian''}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaModel\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained(''roberta-base'')\nmodel = RobertaModel.from_pretrained(''roberta-base'')\ntext = "Replace me by any text you''d like."\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=''pt'')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import RobertaTokenizer, TFRobertaModel\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained(''roberta-base'')\nmodel = TFRobertaModel.from_pretrained(''roberta-base'')\ntext = "Replace me by any text you''d like."\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=''tf'')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThe training data used for this model contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from\nneutral. Therefore, the model can have biased predictions:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline(''fill-mask'', model=''roberta-base'')\n>>> unmasker("The man worked as a <mask>.")\n\n[{''sequence'': ''<s>The man worked as a mechanic.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.08702439814805984,\n  ''token'': 25682,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġmechanic''},\n {''sequence'': ''<s>The man worked as a waiter.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.0819653645157814,\n  ''token'': 38233,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġwaiter''},\n {''sequence'': ''<s>The man worked as a butcher.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.073323555290699,\n  ''token'': 32364,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġbutcher''},\n {''sequence'': ''<s>The man worked as a miner.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.046322137117385864,\n  ''token'': 18678,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġminer''},\n {''sequence'': ''<s>The man worked as a guard.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.040150221437215805,\n  ''token'': 2510,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġguard''}]\n\n>>> unmasker("The Black woman worked as a <mask>.")\n\n[{''sequence'': ''<s>The Black woman worked as a waitress.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.22177888453006744,\n  ''token'': 35698,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġwaitress''},\n {''sequence'': ''<s>The Black woman worked as a prostitute.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.19288744032382965,\n  ''token'': 36289,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġprostitute''},\n {''sequence'': ''<s>The Black woman worked as a maid.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.06498628109693527,\n  ''token'': 29754,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġmaid''},\n {''sequence'': ''<s>The Black woman worked as a secretary.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.05375480651855469,\n  ''token'': 2971,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġsecretary''},\n {''sequence'': ''<s>The Black woman worked as a nurse.</s>'',\n  ''score'': 0.05245552211999893,\n  ''token'': 9008,\n  ''token_str'': ''Ġnurse''}]\n```\n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe RoBERTa model was pretrained on the reunion of five datasets:\n- [BookCorpus](https://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb), a dataset consisting of 11,038 unpublished books;\n- [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia) (excluding lists, tables and headers) ;\n- [CC-News](https://commoncrawl.org/2016/10/news-dataset-available/), a dataset containing 63 millions English news\n  articles crawled between September 2016 and February 2019.\n- [OpenWebText](https://github.com/jcpeterson/openwebtext), an opensource recreation of the WebText dataset used to\n  train GPT-2,\n- [Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02847) a dataset containing a subset of CommonCrawl data filtered to match the\n  story-like style of Winograd schemas.\n\nTogether these datasets weigh 160GB of text.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using a byte version of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and a vocabulary size of 50,000. The inputs of\nthe model take pieces of 512 contiguous tokens that may span over documents. The beginning of a new document is marked\nwith `<s>` and the end of one by `</s>`\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n- 15% of the tokens are masked.\n- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `<mask>`.\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n\nContrary to BERT, the masking is done dynamically during pretraining (e.g., it changes at each epoch and is not fixed).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on 1024 V100 GPUs for 500K steps with a batch size of 8K and a sequence length of 512. The\noptimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 6e-4, \\(\beta_{1} = 0.9\\), \\(\beta_{2} = 0.98\\) and\n\\(\epsilon = 1e-6\\), a weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup for 24,000 steps and linear decay of the learning\nrate after.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWhen fine-tuned on downstream tasks, this model achieves the following results:\n\nGlue test results:\n\n| Task | MNLI | QQP  | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | STS-B | MRPC | RTE  |\n|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|\n|      | 87.6 | 91.9 | 92.8 | 94.8  | 63.6 | 91.2  | 90.2 | 78.7 |\n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1907-11692,\n  author    = {Yinhan Liu and\n               Myle Ott and\n               Naman Goyal and\n               Jingfei Du and\n               Mandar Joshi and\n               Danqi Chen and\n               Omer Levy and\n               Mike Lewis and\n               Luke Zettlemoyer and\n               Veselin Stoyanov},\n  title     = {RoBERTa: {A} Robustly Optimized {BERT} Pretraining Approach},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1907.11692},\n  year      = {2019},\n  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {1907.11692},\n  timestamp = {Thu, 01 Aug 2019 08:59:33 +0200},\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-1907-11692.bib},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```\n\n<a href="https://huggingface.co/exbert/?model=roberta-base">\n	<img width="300px" src="https://cdn-media.huggingface.co/exbert/button.png">\n</a>\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"fill-mask","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":124697947,"storage_bytes":3467440206,"files_count":13,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["RobertaForMaskedLM"],"model_type":"roberta","tokenizer_config":{}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:pytorch:fairseq","source_url":"https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:jcpeterson:openwebtext","source_url":"https://github.com/jcpeterson/openwebtext"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:1907.11692","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:1806.02847","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02847"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 62.3, '2fe9dcbcc772d134bdfff0719e32da3a', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

GLM-4.5 has **355** billion total parameters with **32** billion active parameters, while GLM-4.5-Air adopts a more compact design with **106** billion total parameters and **12** billion active parameters. GLM-4.5 models unify reasoning, coding, and intelligent agent capabilities to meet the complex demands of intelligent agent applications.\n\nBoth GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air are hybrid reasoning models that provide two modes: thinking mode for complex reasoning and tool usage, and non-thinking mode for immediate responses.\n\nWe have open-sourced the base models, hybrid reasoning models, and FP8 versions of the hybrid reasoning models for both GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air. They are released under the MIT open-source license and can be used commercially and for secondary development.\n\nAs demonstrated in our comprehensive evaluation across 12 industry-standard benchmarks, GLM-4.5 achieves exceptional performance with a score of **63.2**, in the **3rd** place among all the proprietary and open-source  models. Notably, GLM-4.5-Air delivers competitive results at **59.8** while maintaining superior efficiency.\n\n![bench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zai-org/GLM-4.5/refs/heads/main/resources/bench.png)\n\nFor more eval results, show cases, and technical details, please visit\nour [technical blog](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5) or [technical report](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.06471).\n\nThe model code, tool parser and reasoning parser can be found in the implementation of [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/src/transformers/models/glm4_moe), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/model_executor/models/glm4_moe_mtp.py) and [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nPlease refer our [github page](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-4.5) for more detail.', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":110468824832,"storage_bytes":220959914155,"files_count":55,"spaces_count":22,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Glm4MoeForCausalLM"],"model_type":"glm4_moe","tokenizer_config":{"eos_token":"<|endoftext|>","pad_token":"<|endoftext|>"},"chat_template_jinja":"[gMASK]<sop>\n{%- if tools -%}\n<|system|>\n# Tools\n\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\n\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\n<tools>\n{% for tool in tools %}\n{{ tool | tojson(ensure_ascii=False) }}\n{% endfor %}\n</tools>\n\nFor each function call, output the function name and arguments within the following XML format:\n<tool_call>{function-name}\n<arg_key>{arg-key-1}</arg_key>\n<arg_value>{arg-value-1}</arg_value>\n<arg_key>{arg-key-2}</arg_key>\n<arg_value>{arg-value-2}</arg_value>\n...\n</tool_call>{%- endif -%}\n{%- macro visible_text(content) -%}\n    {%- if content is string -%}\n        {{- content }}\n    {%- elif content is iterable and content is not mapping -%}\n        {%- for item in content -%}\n            {%- if item is mapping and item.type == ''text'' -%}\n                {{- item.text }}\n            {%- elif item is string -%}\n                {{- item }}\n            {%- endif -%}\n        {%- endfor -%}\n    {%- else -%}\n        {{- content }}\n    {%- endif -%}\n{%- endmacro -%}\n{%- set ns = namespace(last_user_index=-1) %}\n{%- for m in messages %}\n    {%- if m.role == ''user'' %}\n        {% set ns.last_user_index = loop.index0 -%}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endfor %}\n{% for m in messages %}\n{%- if m.role == ''user'' -%}<|user|>\n{{ visible_text(m.content) }}\n{{- ''/nothink'' if (enable_thinking is defined and not enable_thinking and not visible_text(m.content).endswith(\"/nothink\")) else '''' -}}\n{%- elif m.role == ''assistant'' -%}\n<|assistant|>\n{%- set reasoning_content = '''' %}\n{%- set content = visible_text(m.content) %}\n{%- if m.reasoning_content is string %}\n    {%- set reasoning_content = m.reasoning_content %}\n{%- else %}\n    {%- if ''</think>'' in content %}\n        {%- set reasoning_content = content.split(''</think>'')[0].rstrip(''\\n'').split(''<think>'')[-1].lstrip(''\\n'') %}\n        {%- set content = content.split(''</think>'')[-1].lstrip(''\\n'') %}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endif %}\n{%- if loop.index0 > ns.last_user_index and reasoning_content -%}\n{{ ''\\n<think>'' + reasoning_content.strip() +  ''</think>''}}\n{%- else -%}\n{{ ''\\n<think></think>'' }}\n{%- endif -%}\n{%- if content.strip() -%}\n{{ ''\\n'' + content.strip() }}\n{%- endif -%}\n{% if m.tool_calls %}\n{% for tc in m.tool_calls %}\n{%- if tc.function %}\n    {%- set tc = tc.function %}\n{%- endif %}\n{{ ''\\n<tool_call>'' + tc.name }}\n{% set _args = tc.arguments %}\n{% for k, v in _args.items() %}\n<arg_key>{{ k }}</arg_key>\n<arg_value>{{ v | tojson(ensure_ascii=False) if v is not string else v }}</arg_value>\n{% endfor %}\n</tool_call>{% endfor %}\n{% endif %}\n{%- elif m.role == ''tool'' -%}\n{%- if m.content is string -%}\n{%- if loop.first or (messages[loop.index0 -

(21 Oct 2025)** ✨ 🎉\n\n🚀 **New Model:** `next-scene_lora-v2-3000.safetensors`\n\n**What''s New in V2:**\n- 🎯 **Trained on higher quality data** for significantly improved results\n- 💪 **Better command responsiveness** - the model follows your prompts more accurately\n- 🖼️ **Fixed black bar artifacts** - no more unwanted black borders on generated images\n- ⚡ **Overall enhanced performance** - smoother transitions and better cinematic flow\n\n**Recommended:** Use V2 for all new projects.\n\n**📥 ComfyUI Workflow:** [workflow-comfyui-basic-next-scene-v2.json](workflow-comfyui-basic-next-scene-v2.json)\n\n### V2 Demo Examples:\n\n![Demo 1 V2](01-update.gif) ![Demo 2 V2](02-update.gif) ![Demo 3 V2](03-update.gif)\n\n---\n\n**next-scene-qwen-image-lora-2509** is a **LoRA adapter fine-tuned on Qwen-Image-Edit (build 2509)**, purpose-built to generate cinematic image sequences with natural visual progression from frame to frame.\n\nThis model enables Qwen Image Edit to think like a film director—understanding camera dynamics, visual composition, and narrative continuity to create shots that flow seamlessly into one another.\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Version 1 (Legacy)\n\n**Model File:** `next-scene_lora_v1-3000.safetensors`  \n**ComfyUI Workflow:** [workflow-comfyui-basic-next-scene.json](workflow-comfyui-basic-next-scene.json)\n\n### V1 Demo Examples:\n\n![Demo 1 V1](01.gif) ![Demo 2 V1](02.gif) ![Demo 3 V1](03.gif)\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 What This Model Does\n\nThis LoRA brings **cinematic storytelling continuity** into AI image generation workflows.\n\nEach output frame functions as the *"Next Scene"* in an evolving visual narrative, maintaining compositional coherence while introducing organic transitions such as:\n\n- **Camera movement:** Dolly shots, push-ins, pull-backs, and tracking moves\n- **Framing evolution:** Wide to close-up transitions, angle shifts, reframing\n- **Environmental reveals:** New characters entering frame, expanded scenery, spatial progression\n- **Atmospheric shifts:** Lighting changes, weather evolution, time-of-day transitions\n\n### Examples of Cinematic Logic:\n\n- *"Next Scene: The camera pulls back from a tight close-up on the airship to a sweeping aerial view, revealing an entire fleet of vessels soaring through a fantasy landscape."*\n\n- *"Next Scene: The camera tracks forward and tilts down, bringing the sun and helicopters closer into frame as a strong lens flare intensifies."*\n\n- *"Next Scene: The camera pans right, removing the dragon and rider from view while revealing more of the floating mountain range in the distance."*\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Usage Instructions\n\n### Basic Setup:\n\n1. Load **Qwen-Image-Edit 2509** as your base model\n2. Add a **LoRA Loader** node and select:\n   - **V2 (Recommended):** `next-scene_lora-v2-3000.safetensors`\n   - **V1 (Legacy):** `next-scene_lora_v1-3000.safetensors`\n3. Set LoRA strength: **0.7 – 0.8** (recommended)\n4. Structure your prompts with **"Next Scene:"** prefix for optimal results\n\n### Example Prompt:\n\n```\nNext Scene: The camera moves slightly forward as sunlight breaks through the clouds, casting a soft glow around the character''s silhouette in the mist. Realistic cinematic style, atmospheric depth.\n```\n\n### Pro Tips:\n\n- Begin prompts with camera direction for stronger continuity\n- Specify lighting and atmospheric changes for mood consistency\n- Chain multiple generations to create sequential storyboards\n- Works particularly well with landscape and establishing shots\n\n---\n\n## 🎬 Design Philosophy\n\nTrained on an extensive, curated cinematic dataset (proprietary), this model has learned to *think directionally* rather than just visually.\n\nIt doesn''t simply modify an image—it **advances the story**, preserving spatial relationships, lighting consistency, and emotional resonance across sequential frames.\n\n### Ideal Applications:\n\n- **Storyboard generation** for film and animation pre-production\n- **Cinematic AI video pipelines** requiring frame-to-frame coherence\n- **Sequential narrative workflows** in ComfyUI and similar tools\n- **Concept art evolution** showing scene progression\n- **Visual storytelling** for creative projects and presentations\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Important Limitations\n\n- **Not optimized for:** Static portraits, single-image illustration tasks, or non-sequential edits\n- **Best suited for:** Multi-frame workflows with narrative progression\n- **Design priority:** Storytelling flow and continuity over isolated image perfection\n- **Recommended use case:** Scene-to-scene transitions rather than detailed object manipulation\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 Technical Specifications\n\n- **Base Model:** Qwen-Image-Edit (build 2509)\n- **Architecture:** Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n- **Training Objective:** Scene continuity and cinematic shot coherence\n- **Dataset:** Large-scale proprietary cinematic imagery\n- **Recommended Strength:** 0.7–0.8\n- **Compatible Platforms:** ComfyUI, Automatic1111 (with Qwen support), custom pipelines\n\n---\n\n## 📄 License\n\n**MIT License** — Free for research, educational, and creative use.\n\nCommercial applications require independent testing and proper attribution. See LICENSE file for full terms.\n\n---\n\n## 🌐 Creator\n\nDeveloped by **[@lovis93](https://huggingface.co/lovis93)**\n\nPushing the boundaries of AI-directed visual storytelling and cinematic image generation.\n\n---\n\n## 🐦 Share This Model\n\n🎥 Introducing **next-scene-qwen-image-lora-2509**\n\nA LoRA fine-tuned for **Qwen-Image-Edit 2509** that thinks like a film director.\n\nIt evolves each frame naturally—new angles, new lighting, same coherent world.\n\nPerfect for cinematic storyboards, sequential edits, and "Next Scene" workflows.\n\n👉 https://huggingface.co/lovis93/next-scene-qwen-image-lora-2509\n\n#AIart #ComfyUI #Qwen #LoRA #GenerativeAI #AIcinema #ImageEditing', '{"pipeline_tag":"image-to-image","library_name":"diffusers","framework":"diffusers","params":null,"storage_bytes":616421537,"files_count":12,"spaces_count":34,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":null}', '[]', '[]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 62.2, '4974b28f49dd8f74ce893e7a46995bd6', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Meanwhile, specifying `enable_thinking=False` is no longer required.**\n\nFor more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n\n## Performance\n\n|  | GPT-4.1-nano-2025-04-14 | Qwen3-30B-A3B Non-Thinking | Qwen3-4B Non-Thinking | Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 |\n|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Knowledge** | | | |\n| MMLU-Pro | 62.8 | 69.1 | 58.0 | **69.6** |\n| MMLU-Redux | 80.2 | 84.1 | 77.3 | **84.2** |\n| GPQA | 50.3 | 54.8 | 41.7 | **62.0** |\n| SuperGPQA | 32.2 | 42.2 | 32.0 | **42.8** |\n| **Reasoning** | | | |\n| AIME25 | 22.7 | 21.6 | 19.1 | **47.4** |\n| HMMT25 | 9.7 | 12.0 | 12.1 | **31.0** |\n| ZebraLogic | 14.8 | 33.2 | 35.2 | **80.2** |\n| LiveBench 20241125 | 41.5 | 59.4 | 48.4 | **63.0** |\n| **Coding** | | | |\n| LiveCodeBench v6 (25.02-25.05) | 31.5 | 29.0 | 26.4 | **35.1** |\n| MultiPL-E | 76.3 | 74.6 | 66.6 | **76.8** |\n| Aider-Polyglot |  9.8 | **24.4** | 13.8 | 12.9 |\n| **Alignment** | | | |\n| IFEval | 74.5 | **83.7** | 81.2 | 83.4 |\n| Arena-Hard v2* | 15.9 | 24.8 | 9.5 | **43.4** |\n| Creative Writing v3 | 72.7 | 68.1 | 53.6 | **83.5** |\n| WritingBench | 66.9 | 72.2 | 68.5 | **83.4** |\n| **Agent** | | | |\n| BFCL-v3 | 53.0 | 58.6 | 57.6 | **61.9** |\n| TAU1-Retail | 23.5 | 38.3 | 24.3 | **48.7** |\n| TAU1-Airline | 14.0 | 18.0 | 16.0 | **32.0** |\n| TAU2-Retail | - | 31.6 | 28.1 | **40.4** |\n| TAU2-Airline | - | 18.0 | 12.0 | **24.0** |\n| TAU2-Telecom | - | **18.4** | 17.5 | 13.2 |\n| **Multilingualism** | | | |\n| MultiIF | 60.7 | **70.8** | 61.3 | 69.0 |\n| MMLU-ProX | 56.2 | **65.1** | 49.6 | 61.6 |\n| INCLUDE | 58.6 | **67.8** | 53.8 | 60.1 |\n| PolyMATH | 15.6 | 23.3 | 16.6 | **31.1** |\n\n*: For reproducibility, we report the win rates evaluated by GPT-4.1.\n\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThe code of Qwen3 has been in the latest Hugging Face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.51.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen3''\n```\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. \n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto"\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=16384\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\nprint("content:", content)\n```\n\nFor deployment, you can use `sglang>=0.4.6.post1` or `vllm>=0.8.5` or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\n- SGLang:\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 --context-length 262144\n    ```\n- vLLM:\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 --max-model-len 262144\n    ```\n\n**Note: If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues, consider reducing the context length to a shorter value, such as `32,768`.**\n\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\n\n## Agentic Use\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n```python\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n    ''model'': ''Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507'',\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    ''model_server'': ''http://localhost:8000/v1'',  # api_base\n    ''api_key'': ''EMPTY'',\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {''mcpServers'': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            ''time'': {\n                ''command'': ''uvx'',\n                ''args'': [''mcp-server-time'', ''--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai'']\n            },\n            "fetch": {\n                "command": "uvx",\n                "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  ''code_interpreter'',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{''role'': ''user'', ''content'': ''https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen''}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - We suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 16,384 tokens for most queries, which is adequate for instruct models.\n\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n   - **Math Problems**: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `"answer": "C"`."\n\n### Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\n      title={Qwen3 Technical Report}, \n      author={Qwen Team},\n      year={2025},\n      eprint={2505.09388},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388}, \n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":4022468096,"storage_bytes":64383326441,"files_count":13,"spaces_count":80,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Qwen3ForCausalLM"],"model_type":"qwen3","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":null,"chat_template":"{%- if tools %}\n    {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' }}\n    {%- if messages[0].role == ''system'' %}\n        {{- messages[0].content + ''\\n\\n'' }}\n    {%- endif %}\n    {{- \"# Tools\\n\\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\\n\\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:\\n<tools>\" }}\n    {%- for tool in tools %}\n        {{- \"\\n\" }}\n        {{- tool | tojson }}\n    {%- endfor %}\n    {{- \"\\n</tools>\\n\\nFor each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:\\n<tool_call>\\n{\\\"name\\\": <function-name>, \\\"arguments\\\": <args-json-object>}\\n</tool_call><|im_end|>\\n\" }}\n{%- else %}\n    {%- if messages[0].role == ''system'' %}\n        {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' + messages[0].content + ''<|im_end|>\\n'' }}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endif %}\n{%- for message in messages %}\n    {%- if message.content is string %}\n        {%- set content = message.content %}\n    {%- else %}\n        {%- set content = '''' %}\n    {%- endif %}\n    {%- if (message.role == \"user\") or (message.role == \"system\" and not loop.first) %}\n        {{- ''<|im_start|>'' + message.role + ''\\n'' + content + ''<|im_end|>'' + ''\\n'' }}\n    {%- elif message.role == \"assistant\" %}\n        {{- ''<|im_start|>'' + message.role + ''\\n'' + content }}\n        {%- if message.tool_calls %}\n            {%- for tool_call in message.tool_calls %}\n                {%- if (loop.first and content) or (not loop.first) %}\n                    {{- ''\\n'' }}\n                {%- endif %}\n                {%- if tool_call.function %}\n                    {%- set tool_call = tool_call.function %}\n                {%- endif %}\n                {{- ''<tool_call>\\n{\"name\": \"'' }}\n                {{- tool_call.name }}\n                {{- ''\", \"arguments\": '' }}\n                {%- if tool_call.arguments is string %}\n                    {{- tool_call.arguments }}\n                {%- else %}\n                    {{- tool_call.arguments | tojson }}\n                {%- endif %}\n                {{- ''}\\n</tool_call>'' }}\n            {%- endfor %}\n        {%- endif %}\n        {{- ''<|im_end|>\\n'' }}\n    {%- elif message.role == \"tool\" %}\n        {%- if loop.first or (messages[loop.index0 - 1].role != \"tool\") %}\n            {{- ''<|im_start|>user'' }}\n        {%- endif %}\n        {{- ''\\n<tool_response>\\n'' }}\n        {{- content }}\n        {{- ''\\n</tool_response>'' }}\n        {%- if loop.last or (messages[loop.index0 + 1].role != \"tool\") %}\n            {{- ''<|im_end|>\\n'' }}\n        {%- endif %}\n    {%- endif %}\n{%- endfor %}\n{%- if add_generation_prompt %}\n    {{- ''<|im_start|>assistant\\n'' }}\n{%- endif %}","eos_token":"<|im_end|>","pad_token":"<|endoftext|>","unk_token":null}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:QwenLM:Qwen3","source_url":"https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:QwenLM:Qwen-Agent","source_url":"https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2505.09388","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 62.2, '35c9b85304ec56b650b3c13c740ad991', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Trained on 680k hours \nof labelled data, Whisper models demonstrate a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains **without** the need \nfor fine-tuning.\n\nWhisper was proposed in the paper [Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) \nby Alec Radford et al from OpenAI. The original code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/whisper).\n\n<div class="course-tip course-tip-orange bg-gradient-to-br dark:bg-gradient-to-r before:border-orange-500 dark:before:border-orange-800 from-orange-50 dark:from-gray-900 to-white dark:to-gray-950 border border-orange-50 text-orange-700 dark:text-gray-400">\n  <p><b>Update:</b> following the release of the paper, the Whisper authors announced a <a href="ttps://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v2"> large-v2</a> model trained for 2.5x more epochs with regularization.

The English-only models were trained \non the task of speech recognition. The multilingual models were trained on both speech recognition and speech \ntranslation. For speech recognition, the model predicts transcriptions in the *same* language as the audio. \nFor speech translation, the model predicts transcriptions to a *different* language to the audio.\n\nWhisper checkpoints come in five configurations of varying model sizes.\nThe smallest four are trained on either English-only or multilingual data.\nThe largest checkpoints are multilingual only. All ten of the pre-trained checkpoints \nare available on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=openai/whisper). The \ncheckpoints are summarised in the following table with links to the models on the Hub:\n\n| Size     | Parameters | English-only                                         | Multilingual                                        |\n|----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| tiny     | 39 M       | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny.en)   | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny)     |\n| base     | 74 M       | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base.en)   | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base)     |\n| small    | 244 M      | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-small.en)  | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-small)    |\n| medium   | 769 M      | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-medium.en) | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-medium)   |\n| large    | 1550 M     | x                                                    | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large)    |\n| large-v2 | 1550 M     | x                                                    | [✓](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v2) |\n\n# Usage\n\nTo transcribe audio samples, the model has to be used alongside a [`WhisperProcessor`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/whisper#transformers.WhisperProcessor).\n\nThe `WhisperProcessor` is used to:\n1. Pre-process the audio inputs (converting them to log-Mel spectrograms for the model)\n2. Post-process the model outputs (converting them from tokens to text)\n\nThe model is informed of which task to perform (transcription or translation) by passing the appropriate "context tokens". These context tokens \nare a sequence of tokens that are given to the decoder at the start of the decoding process, and take the following order:\n1. The transcription always starts with the `<|startoftranscript|>` token\n2. The second token is the language token (e.g. `<|en|>` for English)\n3. The third token is the "task token". It can take one of two values: `<|transcribe|>` for speech recognition or `<|translate|>` for speech translation\n4. In addition, a `<|notimestamps|>` token is added if the model should not include timestamp prediction\n\nThus, a typical sequence of context tokens might look as follows:\n```\n<|startoftranscript|> <|en|> <|transcribe|> <|notimestamps|>\n```\nWhich tells the model to decode in English, under the task of speech recognition, and not to predict timestamps.\n\nThese tokens can either be forced or un-forced. If they are forced, the model is made to predict each token at \neach position. This allows one to control the output language and task for the Whisper model. If they are un-forced, \nthe Whisper model will automatically predict the output langauge and task itself.\n\nThe context tokens can be set accordingly:\n\n```python\nmodel.config.forced_decoder_ids = WhisperProcessor.get_decoder_prompt_ids(language="english", task="transcribe")\n```\n\nWhich forces the model to predict in English under the task of speech recognition.\n\n## Transcription\n\n### English to English \nIn this example, the context tokens are ''unforced'', meaning the model automatically predicts the output language\n(English) and task (transcribe).\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n\n>>> # load model and processor\n>>> processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large")\n>>> model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large")\n>>> model.config.forced_decoder_ids = None\n\n>>> # load dummy dataset and read audio files\n>>> ds = load_dataset("hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy", "clean", split="validation")\n>>> sample = ds[0]["audio"]\n>>> input_features = processor(sample["array"], sampling_rate=sample["sampling_rate"], return_tensors="pt").input_features \n\n>>> # generate token ids\n>>> predicted_ids = model.generate(input_features)\n>>> # decode token ids to text\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids, skip_special_tokens=False)\n[''<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|notimestamps|> Mr. Quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel.<|endoftext|>'']\n\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n['' Mr. Quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel.'']\n```\nThe context tokens can be removed from the start of the transcription by setting `skip_special_tokens=True`.\n\n### French to French \nThe following example demonstrates French to French transcription by setting the decoder ids appropriately. \n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration\n>>> from datasets import Audio, load_dataset\n\n>>> # load model and processor\n>>> processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large")\n>>> model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large")\n>>> forced_decoder_ids = processor.get_decoder_prompt_ids(language="french", task="transcribe")\n\n>>> # load streaming dataset and read first audio sample\n>>> ds = load_dataset("common_voice", "fr", split="test", streaming=True)\n>>> ds = ds.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16_000))\n>>> input_speech = next(iter(ds))["audio"]\n>>> input_features = processor(input_speech["array"], sampling_rate=input_speech["sampling_rate"], return_tensors="pt").input_features\n\n>>> # generate token ids\n>>> predicted_ids = model.generate(input_features, forced_decoder_ids=forced_decoder_ids)\n>>> # decode token ids to text\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids)\n[''<|startoftranscript|><|fr|><|transcribe|><|notimestamps|> Un vrai travail intéressant va enfin être mené sur ce sujet.<|endoftext|>'']\n\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n['' Un vrai travail intéressant va enfin être mené sur ce sujet.'']\n```\n\n## Translation \nSetting the task to "translate" forces the Whisper model to perform speech translation.\n\n### French to English\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration\n>>> from datasets import Audio, load_dataset\n\n>>> # load model and processor\n>>> processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large")\n>>> model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large")\n>>> forced_decoder_ids = processor.get_decoder_prompt_ids(language="french", task="translate")\n\n>>> # load streaming dataset and read first audio sample\n>>> ds = load_dataset("common_voice", "fr", split="test", streaming=True)\n>>> ds = ds.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16_000))\n>>> input_speech = next(iter(ds))["audio"]\n>>> input_features = processor(input_speech["array"], sampling_rate=input_speech["sampling_rate"], return_tensors="pt").input_features\n\n>>> # generate token ids\n>>> predicted_ids = model.generate(input_features, forced_decoder_ids=forced_decoder_ids)\n>>> # decode token ids to text\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n['' A very interesting work, we will finally be given on this subject.'']\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThis code snippet shows how to evaluate Whisper Large on [LibriSpeech test-clean](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr):\n \n```python\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n>>> from transformers import WhisperForConditionalGeneration, WhisperProcessor\n>>> import torch\n>>> from evaluate import load\n\n>>> librispeech_test_clean = load_dataset("librispeech_asr", "clean", split="test")\n\n>>> processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large")\n>>> model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-large").to("cuda")\n\n>>> def map_to_pred(batch):\n>>>     audio = batch["audio"]\n>>>     input_features = processor(audio["array"], sampling_rate=audio["sampling_rate"], return_tensors="pt").input_features\n>>>     batch["reference"] = processor.tokenizer._normalize(batch[''text''])\n>>> \n>>>     with torch.no_grad():\n>>>         predicted_ids = model.generate(input_features.to("cuda"))[0]\n>>>     transcription = processor.decode(predicted_ids)\n>>>     batch["prediction"] = processor.tokenizer._normalize(transcription)\n>>>     return batch\n\n>>> result = librispeech_test_clean.map(map_to_pred)\n\n>>> wer = load("wer")\n>>> print(100 * wer.compute(references=result["reference"], predictions=result["prediction"]))\n3.0003583080317572\n```\n\n## Long-Form Transcription\n\nThe Whisper model is intrinsically designed to work on audio samples of up to 30s in duration. However, by using a chunking \nalgorithm, it can be used to transcribe audio samples of up to arbitrary length. This is possible through Transformers \n[`pipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline) \nmethod. Chunking is enabled by setting `chunk_length_s=30` when instantiating the pipeline. With chunking enabled, the pipeline \ncan be run with batched inference. It can also be extended to predict sequence level timestamps by passing `return_timestamps=True`:\n\n```python\n>>> import torch\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n\n>>> device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"\n\n>>> pipe = pipeline(\n>>>   "automatic-speech-recognition",\n>>>   model="openai/whisper-large",\n>>>   chunk_length_s=30,\n>>>   device=device,\n>>> )\n\n>>> ds = load_dataset("hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy", "clean", split="validation")\n>>> sample = ds[0]["audio"]\n\n>>> prediction = pipe(sample.copy(), batch_size=8)["text"]\n" Mr. Quilter is the apostle of the middle classes, and we are glad to welcome his gospel."\n\n>>> # we can also return timestamps for the predictions\n>>> prediction = pipe(sample.copy(), batch_size=8, return_timestamps=True)["chunks"]\n[{''text'': '' Mr. Quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel.'',\n  ''timestamp'': (0.0, 5.44)}]\n```\n\nRefer to the blog post [ASR Chunking](https://huggingface.co/blog/asr-chunking) for more details on the chunking algorithm.\n\n## Fine-Tuning\n\nThe pre-trained Whisper model demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to different datasets and domains. However, \nits predictive capabilities can be improved further for certain languages and tasks through *fine-tuning*. The blog \npost [Fine-Tune Whisper with 🤗 Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-whisper) provides a step-by-step \nguide to fine-tuning the Whisper model with as little as 5 hours of labelled data.\n\n### Evaluated Use\n\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI researchers studying robustness, generalization, capabilities, biases, and constraints of the current model. However, Whisper is also potentially quite useful as an ASR solution for developers, especially for English speech recognition. We recognize that once models are released, it is impossible to restrict access to only “intended” uses or to draw reasonable guidelines around what is or is not research.\n\nThe models are primarily trained and evaluated on ASR and speech translation to English tasks. They show strong ASR results in ~10 languages. They may exhibit additional capabilities, particularly if fine-tuned on certain tasks like voice activity detection, speaker classification, or speaker diarization but have not been robustly evaluated in these areas. We strongly recommend that users perform robust evaluations of the models in a particular context and domain before deploying them.\n\nIn particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent or purporting to use these models for any kind of subjective classification. We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes. The models are intended to transcribe and translate speech, use of the model for classification is not only not evaluated but also not appropriate, particularly to infer human attributes.\n\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe models are trained on 680,000 hours of audio and the corresponding transcripts collected from the internet. 65% of this data (or 438,000 hours) represents English-language audio and matched English transcripts, roughly 18% (or 126,000 hours) represents non-English audio and English transcripts, while the final 17% (or 117,000 hours) represents non-English audio and the corresponding transcript. This non-English data represents 98 different languages. \n\nAs discussed in [the accompanying paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf), we see that performance on transcription in a given language is directly correlated with the amount of training data we employ in that language.\n\n\n## Performance and Limitations\n\nOur studies show that, over many existing ASR systems, the models exhibit improved robustness to accents, background noise, technical language, as well as zero shot translation from multiple languages into English; and that accuracy on speech recognition and translation is near the state-of-the-art level. \n\nHowever, because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\n\nOur models perform unevenly across languages, and we observe lower accuracy on low-resource and/or low-discoverability languages or languages where we have less training data. The models also exhibit disparate performance on different accents and dialects of particular languages, which may include higher word error rate across speakers of different genders, races, ages, or other demographic criteria. Our full evaluation results are presented in [the paper accompanying this release](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf). \n\nIn addition, the sequence-to-sequence architecture of the model makes it prone to generating repetitive texts, which can be mitigated to some degree by beam search and temperature scheduling but not perfectly. Further analysis on these limitations are provided in [the paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf). It is likely that this behavior and hallucinations may be worse on lower-resource and/or lower-discoverability languages.\n\n\n## Broader Implications\n\nWe anticipate that Whisper models’ transcription capabilities may be used for improving accessibility tools. While Whisper models cannot be used for real-time transcription out of the box – their speed and size suggest that others may be able to build applications on top of them that allow for near-real-time speech recognition and translation. The real value of beneficial applications built on top of Whisper models suggests that the disparate performance of these models may have real economic implications.\n\nThere are also potential dual use concerns that come with releasing Whisper. While we hope the technology will be used primarily for beneficial purposes, making ASR technology more accessible could enable more actors to build capable surveillance technologies or scale up existing surveillance efforts, as the speed and accuracy allow for affordable automatic transcription and translation of large volumes of audio communication. Moreover, these models may have some capabilities to recognize specific individuals out of the box, which in turn presents safety concerns related both to dual use and disparate performance. In practice, we expect that the cost of transcription is not the limiting factor of scaling up surveillance projects.\n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n```bibtex\n@misc{radford2022whisper,\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2212.04356},\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356},\n  author = {Radford, Alec and Kim, Jong Wook and Xu, Tao and Brockman, Greg and McLeavey, Christine and Sutskever, Ilya},\n  title = {Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision},\n  publisher = {arXiv},\n  year = {2022},\n  copyright = {arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license}\n}\n```\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"automatic-speech-recognition","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":1543304960,"storage_bytes":30868435839,"files_count":16,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["WhisperForConditionalGeneration"],"model_type":"whisper","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"<|endoftext|>","eos_token":"<|endoftext|>","pad_token":"<|endoftext|>","unk_token":"<|endoftext|>"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/whisper"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2212.04356","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 77.2, '79a5529e64f3aa306106ee863ce1123a', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

In all the tasks, OmniVLM outperforms the previous world''s smallest vision-language model.\n\n\n\nWe have conducted a series of experiments on benchmark datasets, including MM-VET, ChartQA, MMMU, ScienceQA, POPE to evaluate the performance of OmniVLM.\n\n| Benchmark         | Nexa AI OmniVLM v2 | Nexa AI OmniVLM v1 | nanoLLAVA |\n|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------|\n| ScienceQA (Eval)  | 71.0                  | 62.2                  | 59.0      |\n| ScienceQA (Test)  | 71.0                  | 64.5                  | 59.0      |\n| POPE              | 93.3                  | 89.4                  | 84.1      |\n| MM-VET            | 30.9                  | 27.5                  | 23.9      |\n| ChartQA (Test)    | 61.9                  | 59.2                  | NA        |\n| MMMU (Test)       | 42.1                  | 41.8                  | 28.6      |\n| MMMU (Eval)       | 40.0                  | 39.9                  | 30.4      |\n\n\n## How to Use On Device\nIn the following, we demonstrate how to run OmniVLM locally on your device.\n\n**Step 1: Install Nexa-SDK (local on-device inference framework)**\n\n[Install Nexa-SDK](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#install-option-1-executable-installer)\n\n> Nexa-SDK is a open-sourced, local on-device inference framework, supporting text generation, image generation, vision-language models (VLM), audio-language models, speech-to-text (ASR), and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. Installable via Python Package or Executable Installer.\n\n**Step 2: Then run the following code in your terminal**\n\n```bash\nnexa run omniVLM \n```\n\n## Model Architecture ##\nOmniVLM''s architecture consists of three key components:\n\n- Base Language Model: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct functions as the base model to process text inputs\n- Vision Encoder: SigLIP-400M operates at 384 resolution with 14×14 patch size to generate image embeddings\n- Projection Layer: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) aligns the vision encoder''s embeddings with the language model''s token space. Compared to vanilla Llava architecture, we designed a projector that reduce 9X image tokens.\n\nThe vision encoder first transforms input images into embeddings, which are then processed by the projection layer to match the token space of Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, enabling end-to-end visual-language understanding.\n\n## Training\n\nWe developed OmniVLM through a three-stage training pipeline:\n\n**Pretraining:**\nThe initial stage focuses on establishing basic visual-linguistic alignments using image-caption pairs, during which only the projection layer parameters are unfrozen to learn these fundamental relationships.\n\n**Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):**\nWe enhance the model''s contextual understanding using image-based question-answering datasets. This stage involves training on structured chat histories that incorporate images for the model to generate more contextually appropriate responses.\n\n**Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):**\nThe final stage implements DPO by first generating responses to images using the base model. A teacher model then produces minimally edited corrections while maintaining high semantic similarity with the original responses, focusing specifically on accuracy-critical elements. These original and corrected outputs form chosen-rejected pairs. The fine-tuning targeted at essential model output improvements without altering the model''s core response characteristics\n\n## What''s next for OmniVLM?\nOmniVLM is in early development and we are working to address current limitations:\n- Expand DPO Training: Increase the scope of DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) training in an iterative process to continually improve model performance and response quality.\n- Improve document and text understanding\n  \nIn the long term, we aim to develop OmniVLM as a fully optimized, production-ready solution for edge AI multimodal applications.\n\n### Follow us\n[Blogs](https://nexa.ai/blogs/OmniVLM) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/nexa-ai) | [X(Twitter)](https://x.com/nexa_ai)', '{"pipeline_tag":null,"library_name":null,"framework":null,"params":null,"storage_bytes":9252221248,"files_count":10,"spaces_count":6,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":null}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:NexaAI:nexa-sdk","source_url":"https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#install-option-1-executable-installer"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2412.11475","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11475"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 82.2, 'e2ad44ccea24c4e225d59e2ceab20c6d', NULL, 'https://huggingface.co/NexaAI/OmniVLM-968M/resolve/main/benchmark.png', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Magenta RealTime enables the\ncontinuous generation of musical audio steered by a text prompt, an audio\nexample, or a weighted combination of multiple text prompts and/or audio\nexamples. Its relatively small size makes it possible to deploy in environments\nwith limited resources, including live performance settings or freely available\nColab TPUs.\n\n### System Components\n\nMagenta RealTime is composed of three components: SpectroStream, MusicCoCa, and\nan LLM. A full technical report with more details on each component is\n[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04651).\n\n1.  **SpectroStream** is a discrete audio codec that converts stereo 48kHz audio\n    into tokens, building on the SoundStream RVQ codec from\n    [Zeghidour+ 21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03312)\n1.  **MusicCoCa** is a contrastive-trained model capable of embedding audio and\n    text into a common embedding space, building on\n    [Yu+ 22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01917) and\n    [Huang+ 22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12415).\n1.  An **encoder-decoder Transformer LLM** generates audio tokens given context\n    audio tokens and a tokenized MusicCoCa embedding, building on the MusicLM\n    method from [Agostinelli+ 23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11325)\n\n### Inputs and outputs\n\n-   **SpectroStream RVQ codec**: Tokenizes high-fidelity music audio\n    -   **Encoder input / Decoder output**: Music audio waveforms, 48kHz stereo\n    -   **Encoder output / Decoder input**: Discrete audio tokens, 25Hz frame\n        rate, 64 RVQ depth, 10 bit codes, 16kbps\n-   **MusicCoCa**: Joint embeddings of text and music audio\n    -   **Input**: Music audio waveforms, 16kHz mono, or text representation of\n        music style e.g. "heavy metal"\n    -   **Output**: 768 dimensional embedding, quantized to 12 RVQ depth, 10 bit\n        codes\n-   **Encoder-decoder Transformer LLM**: Generates audio tokens given context\n    and style\n    -   **Encoder Input**: (Context, 1000 tokens) 10s of audio context tokens w/\n        4 RVQ depth, (Style, 6 tokens) Quantized MusicCoCa style embedding\n    -   **Decoder Output**: (Generated, 800 tokens) 2s of audio w/ 16 RVQ depth\n\n## Uses\n\nMusic generation models, in particular ones targeted for continuous real-time\ngeneration and control, have a wide range of applications across various\nindustries and domains. The following list of potential uses is not\ncomprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\n\n-   **Interactive Music Creation**\n    -   Live Performance / Improvisation: These models can be used to generate\n        music in a live performance setting, controlled by performers\n        manipulating style embeddings or the audio context\n    -   Accessible Music-Making & Music Therapy: People with impediments to\n        using traditional instruments (skill gaps, disabilities, etc.) can\n        participate in communal jam sessions or solo music creation.\n    -   Video Games: Developers can create a custom soundtrack for users in\n        real-time based on their actions and environment.\n-   **Research**\n    -   Transfer learning: Researchers can leverage representations from\n        MusicCoCa and Magenta RT to recognize musical information.\n-   **Personalization**\n    -   Musicians can finetune models with their own catalog to customize the\n        model to their style (fine tuning support coming soon).\n-   **Education**\n    -   Exploring Genres, Instruments, and History: Natural language prompting\n        enables users to quickly learn about and experiment with musical\n        concepts.\n\n### Out-of-Scope Use\n\nSee our [Terms of Use](#terms-of-use) above for usage we consider out of scope.\n\n## Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nMagenta RT supports the real-time generation and steering of instrumental music.\nThe purpose and intention of this capability is to foster the development of new\nreal-time, interactive co-creation workflows that seamlessly integrate with\nhuman-centered forms of musical creativity.\n\nEvery AI music generation model, including Magenta RT, carries a risk of\nimpacting the economic and cultural landscape of music. We aim to mitigate these\nrisks through the following avenues:\n\n-   Prioritizing human-AI interaction as fundamental in the design of Magenta\n    RT.\n-   Distributing the model under a terms of service that prohibit developers\n    from generating outputs that infringe or violate the rights of others,\n    including rights in copyrighted content.\n-   Training on primarily instrumental data. With specific prompting, this model\n    has been observed to generate some vocal sounds and effects, though those\n    vocal sounds and effects tend to be non-lexical.\n\n### Known limitations\n\n**Coverage of broad musical styles**. Magenta RT''s training data primarily\nconsists of Western instrumental music. As a consequence, Magenta RT has\nincomplete coverage of both vocal performance and the broader landscape of rich\nmusical traditions worldwide. For real-time generation with broader style\ncoverage, we refer users to our\n[Lyria RealTime API](g.co/magenta/lyria-realtime).\n\n**Vocals**. While the model is capable of generating non-lexical vocalizations\nand humming, it is not conditioned on lyrics and is unlikely to generate actual\nwords. However, there remains some risk of generating explicit or\nculturally-insensitive lyrical content.\n\n**Latency**. Because the Magenta RT LLM operates on two second chunks, user\ninputs for the style prompt may take two or more seconds to influence the\nmusical output.\n\n**Limited context**. Because the Magenta RT encoder has a maximum audio context\nwindow of ten seconds, the model is unable to directly reference music that has\nbeen output earlier than that. While the context is sufficient to enable the\nmodel to create melodies, rhythms, and chord progressions, the model is not\ncapable of automatically creating longer-term song structures.\n\n### Benefits\n\nAt the time of release, Magenta RealTime represents the only open weights model\nsupporting real-time, continuous musical audio generation. It is designed\nspecifically to enable live, interactive musical creation, bringing new\ncapabilities to musical performances, art installations, video games, and many\nother applications.\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model\n\nSee our\n[Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/magenta/magenta-realtime/blob/main/notebooks/Magenta_RT_Demo.ipynb)\nand [GitHub repository](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime) for usage\nexamples.\n\n## Training Details\n\n### Training Data\n\nMagenta RealTime was trained on ~190k hours of stock music from multiple\nsources, mostly instrumental.\n\n### Hardware\n\nMagenta RealTime was trained using\n[Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/intro-to-tpu)\nhardware (TPUv6e / Trillium).\n\n### Software\n\nTraining was done using [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) and\n[T5X](https://github.com/google-research/t5x), utilizing\n[SeqIO](https://github.com/google/seqio) for data pipelines. JAX allows\nresearchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware, including\nTPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nModel evaluation metrics and results will be shared in our forthcoming technical\nreport.\n\n## Citation\n\nPlease cite our technical report:\n\n**BibTeX:**\n\n```\n@article{gdmlyria2025live,\n    title={Live Music Models},\n    author={Caillon, Antoine and McWilliams, Brian and Tarakajian, Cassie and Simon, Ian and Manco, Ilaria and Engel, Jesse and Constant, Noah and Li, Pen and Denk, Timo I. and Lalama, Alberto and Agostinelli, Andrea and Huang, Anna and Manilow, Ethan and Brower, George and Erdogan, Hakan and Lei, Heidi and Rolnick, Itai and Grishchenko, Ivan and Orsini, Manu and Kastelic, Matej and Zuluaga, Mauricio and Verzetti, Mauro and Dooley, Michael and Skopek, Ondrej and Ferrer, Rafael and Borsos, Zal{\''a}n and van den Oord, {\"A}aron and Eck, Douglas and Collins, Eli and Baldridge, Jason and Hume, Tom and Donahue, Chris and Han, Kehang and Roberts, Adam},\n    journal={arXiv:2508.04651},\n    year={2025}\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":null,"library_name":"magenta-realtime","framework":"magenta-realtime","params":null,"storage_bytes":9983404210,"files_count":2844,"spaces_count":2,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":null}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:magenta:magenta-realtime","source_url":"https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:magenta:magenta-realtime","source_url":"https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:magenta:magenta-realtime","source_url":"https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:jax-ml:jax","source_url":"https://github.com/jax-ml/jax"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:t5x","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/t5x"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google:seqio","source_url":"https://github.com/google/seqio"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2508.04651","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04651"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2107.03312","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03312"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2205.01917","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01917"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2208.12415","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12415"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2301.11325","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11325"}]', NULL, 'CC-BY-4.0', 'approved', 77.2, 'b9d5ed76bb54ff028ca51366ef80a040', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
