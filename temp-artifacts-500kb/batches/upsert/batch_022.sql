These feature vectors are directly fed into VITS without the need for conversion to a text-based intermediate representation. As a result, the pitch and intonations of the original audio are preserved. Meanwhile, the vocoder was replaced with [NSF HiFiGAN](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger/tree/refactor/modules/nsf_hifigan) to solve the problem of sound interruption.\n\n### 🆕 4.1-Stable Version Update Content\n\n- Feature input is changed to the 12th Layer of [Content Vec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec) Transformer output, And compatible with 4.0 branches.\n- Update the shallow diffusion, you can use the shallow diffusion model to improve the sound quality.\n- Added Whisper-PPG encoder support\n- Added static/dynamic sound fusion\n- Added loudness embedding\n- Added Functionality of feature retrieval from [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI)\n  \n### 🆕 Questions about compatibility with the 4.0 model\n\n- To support the 4.0 model and incorporate the speech encoder, you can make modifications to the `config.json` file. Add the `speech_encoder` field to the "model" section as shown below:\n\n```\n  "model": {\n    .........\n    "ssl_dim": 256,\n    "n_speakers": 200,\n    "speech_encoder":"vec256l9"\n  }\n```\n\n### 🆕 Shallow diffusion\n![Diagram](shadowdiffusion.png)\n\n## 💬 Python Version\n\nBased on our testing, we have determined that the project runs stable on `Python 3.8.9`.\n\n## 📥 Pre-trained Model Files\n\n#### **Required**\n\n**You need to select one encoder from the list below**\n\n##### **1.

It is advisable to consult with the author beforehand or carefully review the description to ascertain the permissible usage of the model. This helps ensure compliance with any specified guidelines or restrictions regarding its utilization.\n\n#### **Optional(Select as Required)**\n\n##### NSF-HIFIGAN\n\nIf you are using the `NSF-HIFIGAN enhancer` or `shallow diffusion`, you will need to download the pre-trained NSF-HIFIGAN model.\n\n- Pre-trained NSF-HIFIGAN Vocoder: [nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip](https://github.com/openvpi/vocoders/releases/download/nsf-hifigan-v1/nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip)\n  - Unzip and place the four files under the `pretrain/nsf_hifigan` directory\n\n```shell\n# nsf_hifigan\nwget -P pretrain/ https://github.com/openvpi/vocoders/releases/download/nsf-hifigan-v1/nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip\nunzip -od pretrain/nsf_hifigan pretrain/nsf_hifigan_20221211.zip\n# Alternatively, you can manually download and place it in the pretrain/nsf_hifigan directory\n# URL: https://github.com/openvpi/vocoders/releases/tag/nsf-hifigan-v1\n```\n\n##### RMVPE\n\nIf you are using the `rmvpe` F0 Predictor, you will need to download the pre-trained RMVPE model.\n\n+ download model at [rmvpe.zip](https://github.com/yxlllc/RMVPE/releases/download/230917/rmvpe.zip), this weight is recommended.\n  + unzip `rmvpe.zip`，and rename the `model.pt` file to `rmvpe.pt` and place it under the `pretrain` directory.\n\n- ~~download model at [rmvpe.pt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ylzz1997/rmvpe_pretrain_model/resolve/main/rmvpe.pt)~~\n  - ~~Place it under the `pretrain` directory~~\n\n##### FCPE(Preview version)\n\n[FCPE(Fast Context-base Pitch Estimator)](https://github.com/CNChTu/MelPE) is a dedicated F0 predictor designed for real-time voice conversion and will become the preferred F0 predictor for sovits real-time voice conversion in the future.(The paper is being written)\n\nIf you are using the `fcpe` F0 Predictor, you will need to download the pre-trained FCPE model.\n\n- download model at [fcpe.pt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ylzz1997/rmvpe_pretrain_model/resolve/main/fcpe.pt)\n  - Place it under the `pretrain` directory\n\n## 📊 Dataset Preparation\n\nSimply place the dataset in the `dataset_raw` directory with the following file structure:\n\n```\ndataset_raw\n├───speaker0\n│   ├───xxx1-xxx1.wav\n│   ├───...\n│   └───Lxx-0xx8.wav\n└───speaker1\n    ├───xx2-0xxx2.wav\n    ├───...\n    └───xxx7-xxx007.wav\n```\nThere are no specific restrictions on the format of the name for each audio file (naming conventions such as `000001.wav` to `999999.wav` are also valid), but the file type must be `WAV``.\n\nYou can customize the speaker''s name as showed below:\n\n```\ndataset_raw\n└───suijiSUI\n    ├───1.wav\n    ├───...\n    └───25788785-20221210-200143-856_01_(Vocals)_0_0.wav\n```\n\n## 🛠️ Preprocessing\n\n### 0. Slice audio\n\nTo avoid video memory overflow during training or pre-processing, it is recommended to limit the length of audio clips. Cutting the audio to a length of "5s - 15s" is more recommended. Slightly longer times are acceptable, however, excessively long clips may cause problems such as `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError`.\n\nTo facilitate the slicing process, you can use [audio-slicer-GUI](https://github.com/flutydeer/audio-slicer) or [audio-slicer-CLI](https://github.com/openvpi/audio-slicer)\n\nIn general, only the `Minimum Interval` needs to be adjusted. For spoken audio, the default value usually suffices, while for singing audio, it can be adjusted to around `100` or even `50`, depending on the specific requirements.\n\nAfter slicing, it is recommended to remove any audio clips that are excessively long or too short.\n\n**If you are using whisper-ppg encoder for training, the audio clips must shorter than 30s.**\n\n### 1. Resample to 44100Hz and mono\n\n```shell\npython resample.py\n```\n\n#### Cautions\n\nAlthough this project has resample.py scripts for resampling, mono and loudness matching, the default loudness matching is to match to 0db. This can cause damage to the sound quality. While python''s loudness matching package pyloudnorm does not limit the level, this can lead to sonic boom. Therefore, it is recommended to consider using professional sound processing software, such as `adobe audition` for loudness matching. If you are already using other software for loudness matching, add the parameter `-skip_loudnorm` to the run command:\n\n```shell\npython resample.py --skip_loudnorm\n```\n\n### 2. Automatically split the dataset into training and validation sets, and generate configuration files.\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_flist_config.py --speech_encoder vec768l12\n```\n\nspeech_encoder has the following options\n\n```\nvec768l12\nvec256l9\nhubertsoft\nwhisper-ppg\ncnhubertlarge\ndphubert\nwhisper-ppg-large\nwavlmbase+\n```\n\nIf the speech_encoder argument is omitted, the default value is `vec768l12`\n\n**Use loudness embedding**\n\nAdd `--vol_aug` if you want to enable loudness embedding:\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_flist_config.py --speech_encoder vec768l12 --vol_aug\n```\n\nAfter enabling loudness embedding, the trained model will match the loudness of the input source; otherwise, it will match the loudness of the training set.\n\n#### You can modify some parameters in the generated config.json and diffusion.yaml\n\n* `keep_ckpts`: Keep the the the number of previous models during training. Set to `0` to keep them all. Default is `3`.\n\n* `all_in_mem`: Load all dataset to RAM. It can be enabled when the disk IO of some platforms is too low and the system memory is **much larger** than your dataset.\n  \n* `batch_size`: The amount of data loaded to the GPU for a single training session can be adjusted to a size lower than the GPU memory capacity.\n\n* `vocoder_name`: Select a vocoder. The default is `nsf-hifigan`.\n\n##### diffusion.yaml\n\n* `cache_all_data`: Load all dataset to RAM. It can be enabled when the disk IO of some platforms is too low and the system memory is **much larger** than your dataset.\n\n* `duration`: The duration of the audio slicing during training, can be adjusted according to the size of the video memory, **Note: this value must be less than the minimum time of the audio in the training set!**\n\n* `batch_size`: The amount of data loaded to the GPU for a single training session can be adjusted to a size lower than the video memory capacity.\n\n* `timesteps`: The total number of steps in the diffusion model, which defaults to 1000.\n\n* `k_step_max`: Training can only train `k_step_max` step diffusion to save training time, note that the value must be less than `timesteps`, 0 is to train the entire diffusion model, **Note: if you do not train the entire diffusion model will not be able to use only_diffusion!**\n\n##### **List of Vocoders**\n\n```\nnsf-hifigan\nnsf-snake-hifigan\n```\n\n### 3. Generate hubert and f0\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_hubert_f0.py --f0_predictor dio\n```\n\nf0_predictor has the following options\n\n```\ncrepe\ndio\npm\nharvest\nrmvpe\nfcpe\n```\n\nIf the training set is too noisy,it is recommended to use `crepe` to handle f0\n\nIf the f0_predictor parameter is omitted, the default value is `rmvpe`\n\nIf you want shallow diffusion (optional), you need to add the `--use_diff` parameter, for example:\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_hubert_f0.py --f0_predictor dio --use_diff\n```\n\n**Speed Up preprocess**\n\nIf your dataset is pretty large,you can increase the param `--num_processes` like that:\n\n```shell\npython preprocess_hubert_f0.py --f0_predictor dio --num_processes 8\n```\nAll the worker will be assigned to different GPU if you have more than one GPUs.\n\nAfter completing the above steps, the dataset directory will contain the preprocessed data, and the dataset_raw folder can be deleted.\n\n## 🏋️‍ Training\n\n### Sovits Model\n\n```shell\npython train.py -c configs/config.json -m 44k\n```\n\n### Diffusion Model (optional)\n\nIf the shallow diffusion function is needed, the diffusion model needs to be trained. The diffusion model training method is as follows:\n\n```shell\npython train_diff.py -c configs/diffusion.yaml\n```\n\nDuring training, the model files will be saved to `logs/44k`, and the diffusion model will be saved to `logs/44k/diffusion`\n\n## 🤖 Inference\n\nUse [inference_main.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/inference_main.py)\n\n```shell\n# Example\npython inference_main.py -m "logs/44k/G_30400.pth" -c "configs/config.json" -n "君の知らない物語-src.wav" -t 0 -s "nen"\n```\n\nRequired parameters:\n- `-m` | `--model_path`: path to the model.\n- `-c` | `--config_path`: path to the configuration file.\n- `-n` | `--clean_names`: a list of wav file names located in the `raw` folder.\n- `-t` | `--trans`: pitch shift, supports positive and negative (semitone) values.\n- `-s` | `--spk_list`: Select the speaker ID to use for conversion.\n- `-cl` | `--clip`: Forced audio clipping, set to 0 to disable(default), setting it to a non-zero value (duration in seconds) to enable.\n\nOptional parameters: see the next section\n- `-lg` | `--linear_gradient`: The cross fade length of two audio slices in seconds. If there is a discontinuous voice after forced slicing, you can adjust this value. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the default value of 0.\n- `-f0p` | `--f0_predictor`: Select a F0 predictor, options are `crepe`, `pm`, `dio`, `harvest`, `rmvpe`,`fcpe`, default value is `pm`(note: f0 mean pooling will be enable when using `crepe`)\n- `-a` | `--auto_predict_f0`: automatic pitch prediction, do not enable this when converting singing voices as it can cause serious pitch issues.\n- `-cm` | `--cluster_model_path`: Cluster model or feature retrieval index path, if left blank, it will be automatically set as the default path of these models. If there is no training cluster or feature retrieval, fill in at will.\n- `-cr` | `--cluster_infer_ratio`: The proportion of clustering scheme or feature retrieval ranges from 0 to 1. If there is no training clustering model or feature retrieval, the default is 0.\n- `-eh` | `--enhance`: Whether to use NSF_HIFIGAN enhancer, this option has certain effect on sound quality enhancement for some models with few training sets, but has negative effect on well-trained models, so it is disabled by default.\n- `-shd` | `--shallow_diffusion`: Whether to use shallow diffusion, which can solve some electrical sound problems after use. This option is disabled by default. When this option is enabled, NSF_HIFIGAN enhancer will be disabled\n- `-usm` | `--use_spk_mix`: whether to use dynamic voice fusion\n- `-lea` | `--loudness_envelope_adjustment`：The adjustment of the input source''s loudness envelope in relation to the fusion ratio of the output loudness envelope. The closer to 1, the more the output loudness envelope is used\n- `-fr` | `--feature_retrieval`：Whether to use feature retrieval If clustering model is used, it will be disabled, and `cm` and `cr` parameters will become the index path and mixing ratio of feature retrieval\n  \nShallow diffusion settings:\n- `-dm` | `--diffusion_model_path`: Diffusion model path\n- `-dc` | `--diffusion_config_path`: Diffusion config file path\n- `-ks` | `--k_step`: The larger the number of k_steps, the closer it is to the result of the diffusion model. The default is 100\n- `-od` | `--only_diffusion`: Whether to use Only diffusion mode, which does not load the sovits model to only use diffusion model inference\n- `-se` | `--second_encoding`：which involves applying an additional encoding to the original audio before shallow diffusion. This option can yield varying results - sometimes positive and sometimes negative.\n\n### Cautions\n\nIf inferencing using `whisper-ppg` speech encoder, you need to set `--clip` to 25 and `-lg` to 1. Otherwise it will fail to infer properly.\n\n## 🤔 Optional Settings\n\nIf you are satisfied with the previous results, or if you do not feel you understand what follows, you can skip it and it will have no effect on the use of the model. The impact of these optional settings mentioned is relatively small, and while they may have some impact on specific datasets, in most cases the difference may not be significant.\n\n### Automatic f0 prediction\n\nDuring the training of the 4.0 model, an f0 predictor is also trained, which enables automatic pitch prediction during voice conversion. However, if the results are not satisfactory, manual pitch prediction can be used instead. Please note that when converting singing voices, it is advised not to enable this feature as it may cause significant pitch shifting.\n\n- Set `auto_predict_f0` to `true` in `inference_main.py`.\n\n### Cluster-based timbre leakage control\n\nIntroduction: The clustering scheme implemented in this model aims to reduce timbre leakage and enhance the similarity of the trained model to the target''s timbre, although the effect may not be very pronounced. However, relying solely on clustering can reduce the model''s clarity and make it sound less distinct. Therefore, a fusion method is adopted in this model to control the balance between the clustering and non-clustering approaches. This allows manual adjustment of the trade-off between "sounding like the target''s timbre" and "have clear enunciation" to find an optimal balance.\n\nNo changes are required in the existing steps. Simply train an additional clustering model, which incurs relatively low training costs.\n\n- Training process:\n  - Train on a machine with good CPU performance. According to extant experience, it takes about 4 minutes to train each speaker on a Tencent Cloud machine with 6-core CPU.\n  - Execute `python cluster/train_cluster.py`. The output model will be saved in `logs/44k/kmeans_10000.pt`.\n  - The clustering model can currently be trained using the gpu by executing `python cluster/train_cluster.py --gpu`\n- Inference process:\n  - Specify `cluster_model_path` in `inference_main.py`. If not specified, the default is `logs/44k/kmeans_10000.pt`.\n  - Specify `cluster_infer_ratio` in `inference_main.py`, where `0` means not using clustering at all, `1` means only using clustering, and usually `0.5` is sufficient.\n\n### Feature retrieval\n\nIntroduction: As with the clustering scheme, the timbre leakage can be reduced, the enunciation is slightly better than clustering, but it will reduce the inference speed. By employing the fusion method, it becomes possible to linearly control the balance between feature retrieval and non-feature retrieval, allowing for fine-tuning of the desired proportion.\n\n- Training process: \n  First, it needs to be executed after generating hubert and f0: \n\n```shell\npython train_index.py -c configs/config.json\n```\n\nThe output of the model will be in `logs/44k/feature_and_index.pkl`\n\n- Inference process: \n  - The `--feature_retrieval` needs to be formulated first, and the clustering mode automatically switches to the feature retrieval mode.\n  - Specify `cluster_model_path` in `inference_main.py`. If not specified, the default is `logs/44k/feature_and_index.pkl`.\n  - Specify `cluster_infer_ratio` in `inference_main.py`, where `0` means not using feature retrieval at all, `1` means only using feature retrieval, and usually `0.5` is sufficient.\n\n## 🗜️ Model compression\n\nThe generated model contains data that is needed for further training. If you confirm that the model is final and not be used in further training, it is safe to remove these data to get smaller file size (about 1/3).\n\n```shell\n# Example\npython compress_model.py -c="configs/config.json" -i="logs/44k/G_30400.pth" -o="logs/44k/release.pth"\n```\n\n## 👨‍🔧 Timbre mixing\n\n### Static Tone Mixing\n\n**Refer to `webUI.py` file for stable Timbre mixing of the gadget/lab feature.**\n\nIntroduction: This function can combine multiple models into one model (convex combination or linear combination of multiple model parameters) to create mixed voice that do not exist in reality\n\n**Note:**\n1. This feature is only supported for single-speaker models\n2. If you force a multi-speaker model, it is critical to make sure there are the same number of speakers in each model. This will ensure that sounds with the same SpeakerID can be mixed correctly.\n3. Ensure that the `model` fields in config.json of all models to be mixed are the same\n4. The mixed model can use any config.json file from the models being synthesized. However, the clustering model will not be functional after mixed.\n5. When batch uploading models, it is best to put the models into a folder and upload them together after selecting them\n6. It is suggested to adjust the mixing ratio between 0 and 100, or to other numbers, but unknown effects will occur in the linear combination mode\n7. After mixing, the file named output.pth will be saved in the root directory of the project\n8. Convex combination mode will perform Softmax to add the mix ratio to 1, while linear combination mode will not\n\n### Dynamic timbre mixing\n\n**Refer to the `spkmix.py` file for an introduction to dynamic timbre mixing**\n\nCharacter mix track writing rules:\n\nRole ID: \[\[Start time 1, end time 1, start value 1, start value 1], [Start time 2, end time 2, start value 2]]\n\nThe start time must be the same as the end time of the previous one. The first start time must be 0, and the last end time must be 1 (time ranges from 0 to 1).\n\nAll roles must be filled in. For unused roles, fill \[\[0., 1., 0., 0.]]\n\nThe fusion value can be filled in arbitrarily, and the linear change from the start value to the end value within the specified period of time. The \n\ninternal linear combination will be automatically guaranteed to be 1 (convex combination condition), so it can be used safely\n\nUse the `--use_spk_mix` parameter when reasoning to enable dynamic timbre mixing\n\n## 📤 Exporting to Onnx\n\nUse [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)\n\n- Create a folder named `checkpoints` and open it\n- Create a folder in the `checkpoints` folder as your project folder, naming it after your project, for example `aziplayer`\n- Rename your model as `model.pth`, the configuration file as `config.json`, and place them in the `aziplayer` folder you just created\n- Modify `"NyaruTaffy"` in `path = "NyaruTaffy"` in [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py) to your project name, `path = "aziplayer"`（onnx_export_speaker_mix makes you can mix speaker''s voice）\n- Run [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)\n- Wait for it to finish running. A `model.onnx` will be generated in your project folder, which is the exported model.\n\nNote: For Hubert Onnx models, please use the models provided by MoeSS. Currently, they cannot be exported on their own (Hubert in fairseq has many unsupported operators and things involving constants that can cause errors or result in problems with the input/output shape and results when exported.)\n\n\n## 📎 Reference\n\n| URL | Designation | Title | Implementation Source |\n| --- | ----------- | ----- | --------------------- |\n|[2106.06103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06103) | VITS (Synthesizer)| Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Adversarial Learning for End-to-End Text-to-Speech | [jaywalnut310/vits](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits) |\n|[2111.02392](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02392) | SoftVC (Speech Encoder)| A Comparison of Discrete and Soft Speech Units for Improved Voice Conversion | [bshall/hubert](https://github.com/bshall/hubert) |\n|[2204.09224](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09224) | ContentVec (Speech Encoder)| ContentVec: An Improved Self-Supervised Speech Representation by Disentangling Speakers | [auspicious3000/contentvec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec) |\n|[2212.04356](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) | Whisper (Speech Encoder) | Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision | [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) |\n|[2110.13900](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13900) | WavLM (Speech Encoder) | WavLM: Large-Scale Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Full Stack Speech Processing | [microsoft/unilm/wavlm](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/wavlm) |\n|[2305.17651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17651) | DPHubert (Speech Encoder) | DPHuBERT: Joint Distillation and Pruning of Self-Supervised Speech Models | [pyf98/DPHuBERT](https://github.com/pyf98/DPHuBERT) |\n|[DOI:10.21437/Interspeech.2017-68](http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2017-68) | Harvest (F0 Predictor) | Harvest: A high-performance fundamental frequency estimator from speech signals | [mmorise/World/harvest](https://github.com/mmorise/World/blob/master/src/harvest.cpp) |\n|[aes35-000039](https://www.aes.org/e-lib/online/browse.cfm?elib=15165) | Dio (F0 Predictor) | Fast and reliable F0 estimation method based on the period extraction of vocal fold vibration of singing voice and speech | [mmorise/World/dio](https://github.com/mmorise/World/blob/master/src/dio.cpp) |\n|[8461329](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8461329) | Crepe (F0 Predictor) | Crepe: A Convolutional Representation for Pitch Estimation | [maxrmorrison/torchcrepe](https://github.com/maxrmorrison/torchcrepe) |\n|[DOI:10.1016/j.wocn.2018.07.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2018.07.001) | Parselmouth (F0 Predictor) | Introducing Parselmouth: A Python interface to Praat | [YannickJadoul/Parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth) |\n|[2306.15412v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15412v2) | RMVPE (F0 Predictor) | RMVPE: A Robust Model for Vocal Pitch Estimation in Polyphonic Music | [Dream-High/RMVPE](https://github.com/Dream-High/RMVPE) |\n|[2010.05646](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646) | HIFIGAN (Vocoder) | HiFi-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Efficient and High Fidelity Speech Synthesis | [jik876/hifi-gan](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan) |\n|[1810.11946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11946.pdf) | NSF (Vocoder) | Neural source-filter-based waveform model for statistical parametric speech synthesis | [openvpi/DiffSinger/modules/nsf_hifigan](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger/tree/refactor/modules/nsf_hifigan)\n|[2006.08195](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08195) | Snake (Vocoder) | Neural Networks Fail to Learn Periodic Functions and How to Fix It | [EdwardDixon/snake](https://github.com/EdwardDixon/snake)\n|[2105.02446v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02446v3) | Shallow Diffusion (PostProcessing)| DiffSinger: Singing Voice Synthesis via Shallow Diffusion Mechanism | [CNChTu/Diffusion-SVC](https://github.com/CNChTu/Diffusion-SVC) |\n|[K-means](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=01D65490BADCC216F350D06F84D721AD?doi=10.1.1.308.8619&rep=rep1&type=pdf) | Feature K-means Clustering (PreProcessing)| Some methods for classification and analysis of multivariate observations | This repo |\n| | Feature TopK Retrieval (PreProcessing)| Retrieval based Voice Conversion | [RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI) |\n| | whisper ppg| whisper ppg | [PlayVoice/whisper_ppg](https://github.com/PlayVoice/whisper_ppg) |\n| | bigvgan| bigvgan | [PlayVoice/so-vits-svc-5.0](https://github.com/PlayVoice/so-vits-svc-5.0/tree/bigvgan-mix-v2/vits_decoder/alias) |\n\n\n## ☀️ Previous contributors\n\nFor some reason the author deleted the original repository.

It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.\n\n- [Try out Label Studio](#try-out-label-studio)\n- [What you get from Label Studio](#what-you-get-from-label-studio)\n- [Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio](#included-templates-for-labeling-data-in-label-studio)\n- [Set up machine learning models with Label Studio](#set-up-machine-learning-models-with-Label-Studio)\n- [Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools](#integrate-label-studio-with-your-existing-tools)\n\n![Gif of Label Studio annotating different types of data](/images/annotation_examples.gif)\n\nHave a custom dataset? You can customize Label Studio to fit your needs. Read an [introductory blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-label-studio-a-swiss-army-knife-of-data-labeling-140c1be92881) to learn more. \n\n## Try out Label Studio\n\nInstall Label Studio locally or deploy it in a cloud instance. [Or sign up for a free trial of our Starter Cloud edition!](https://humansignal.com/platform/starter-cloud/) You can learn more about what each edition offers [here](https://labelstud.io/guide/label_studio_compare). \n\n- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)\n- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)\n- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)\n- [Install locally with poetry](#install-locally-with-poetry)\n- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)\n- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)\n- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)\n\n### Install locally with Docker\nOfficial Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. \nRun Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n\n```bash\ndocker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest\ndocker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest\n```\nYou can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.\n\n#### Override default Docker install\nYou can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:\n```bash\ndocker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG\n```\n\n#### Build a local image with Docker\nIf you want to build a local image, run:\n```bash\ndocker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .\n```\n\n### Run with Docker Compose\nDocker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:\n\n- Label Studio\n- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.\n- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.\n\nTo start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:\n```bash\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\n### Run with Docker Compose + MinIO\nYou can also run it with an additional MinIO server for local S3 storage. This is particularly useful when you want to \ntest the behavior with S3 storage on your local system. To start Label Studio in this way, you need to run the following command:\n````bash\n# Add sudo on Linux if you are not a member of the docker group\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.minio.yml up -d\n````\nIf you do not have a static IP address, you must create an entry in your hosts file so that both Label Studio and your \nbrowser can access the MinIO server. For more detailed instructions, please refer to [our guide on storing data](docs/source/guide/storedata.md).\n\n\n### Install locally with pip\n\n```bash\n# Requires Python >=3.8\npip install label-studio\n\n# Start the server at http://localhost:8080\nlabel-studio\n```\n\n### Install locally with poetry\n\n```bash\n### install poetry\npip install poetry\n\n### set poetry environment\npoetry new my-label-studio\ncd my-label-studio\npoetry add label-studio\n\n### activate poetry environment\npoetry shell\n\n### Start the server at http://localhost:8080\nlabel-studio\n```\n\n### Install locally with Anaconda\n\n```bash\nconda create --name label-studio\nconda activate label-studio\nconda install psycopg2\npip install label-studio\n```\n\n### Install for local development\n\nYou can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package from pypi. \n\n```bash\n# Install all package dependencies\npip install poetry\npoetry install\n# Run database migrations\npython label_studio/manage.py migrate\npython label_studio/manage.py collectstatic\n# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080\npython label_studio/manage.py runserver\n```\n\n### Deploy in a cloud instance\n\nYou can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: \n\n<a href="https://www.heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy" height="30px"></a>\n[<img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" height="30px">](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fhumansignal%2Flabel-studio%2Fdevelop%2Fazuredeploy.json)\n[<img src="https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg" height="30px">](https://deploy.cloud.run)\n\n\n#### Apply frontend changes\n\nFor information about updating the frontend, see [label-studio/web/README.md](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/develop/web/README.md#installation-instructions).\n\n\n#### Install dependencies on Windows \nTo run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you''re using the correct version of Python:\n- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)\n\n```bash\n# Upgrade pip \npip install -U pip\n\n# If you''re running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:\npip install lxml‑4.5.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl\n\n# Install label studio\npip install label-studio\n```\n\n### Run test suite\nTo add the tests'' dependencies to your local install:\n\n```bash\npoetry install --with test\n```\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to run the unit tests from a Docker container in which the test dependencies are installed:\n\n\n```bash\nmake build-testing-image\nmake docker-testing-shell\n```\n\nIn either case, to run the unit tests:\n\n```bash\ncd label_studio\n\n# sqlite3\nDJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio pytest -vv\n\n# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass. Will not work in Docker\n# testing container without additional configuration)\nDJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio pytest -vv\n```\n \n## What you get from Label Studio\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/525ad5ff-6904-4398-b507-7e8954268d69\n\n- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it''s tied to your account.\n- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.\n- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.\n- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.\n- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. \n- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. \n- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.\n- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline\n\n## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio \n\nLabel Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:\n\n<img src="/images/template-types.png" />\n\n## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio\n\nConnect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-ml-backend).\n2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.\n\nThis lets you:\n\n- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. \n- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. \n- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.\n\n## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools\n\nYou can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  \n\n## Ecosystem\n\n| Project | Description |\n|-|-|\n| label-studio | Server, distributed as a pip package |\n| [Frontend library](web/libs/editor/) | The Label Studio frontend library.

Our new one-step image-to-image translation methods can support both paired and unpaired training and produce better results by leveraging the pre-trained StableDiffusion-Turbo model. The inference time for 512x512 image is 0.29 sec on A6000 and 0.11 sec on A100.\n\nPlease check out [contrastive-unpaired-translation](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation) (CUT), our new unpaired image-to-image translation model that enables fast and memory-efficient training.\n\nWe provide PyTorch implementations for both unpaired and paired image-to-image translation.\n\nThe code was written by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://github.com/junyanz) and [Taesung Park](https://github.com/taesungp), and supported by [Tongzhou Wang](https://github.com/SsnL).\n\nThis PyTorch implementation produces results comparable to or better than our original Torch software. If you would like to reproduce the same results as in the papers, check out the original [CycleGAN Torch](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) and [pix2pix Torch](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) code in Lua/Torch.\n\n**Note**: The current software works well with PyTorch 2.4+. Check out the older [branch](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/tree/pytorch0.3.1) that supports PyTorch 0.1-0.3.\n\nYou may find useful information in [training/test tips](docs/tips.md) and [frequently asked questions](docs/qa.md).

For Conda users, you can create a new Conda environment by\n\n```bash\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n```\n\nand then activate the environment by\n\n```bash\nconda activate pytorch-img2img\n```\n\n- For Docker users, we provide the pre-built Docker image and Dockerfile. Please refer to our [Docker](docs/docker.md) page.\n- For Repl users, please click [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)](https://repl.it/github/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).\n\n### CycleGAN train/test\n\n- Download a CycleGAN dataset (e.g. maps):\n\n```bash\nbash ./datasets/download_cyclegan_dataset.sh maps\n```\n\n- To log training progress and test images to W&B dashboard, set the `--use_wandb` flag with training script\n- Train a model:\n\n```bash\n#!./scripts/train_cyclegan.sh\npython train.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan --use_wandb\n```\n\nTo see more intermediate results, check out `./checkpoints/maps_cyclegan/web/index.html`.\n\n- Test the model:\n\n```bash\n#!./scripts/test_cyclegan.sh\npython test.py --dataroot ./datasets/maps --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan\n```\n\n- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/maps_cyclegan/latest_test/index.html`.\n\n### pix2pix train/test\n\n- Download a pix2pix dataset (e.g.[facades](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/)):\n\n```bash\nbash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades\n```\n\n- To log training progress and test images to W&B dashboard, set the `--use_wandb` flag with training script\n- Train a model:\n\n```bash\n#!./scripts/train_pix2pix.sh\npython train.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA  --use_wandb\n```\n\nTo see more intermediate results, check out `./checkpoints/facades_pix2pix/web/index.html`.\n\n- Test the model (`bash ./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh`):\n\n```bash\n#!./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh\npython test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA\n```\n\n- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/facades_pix2pix/test_latest/index.html`. You can find more scripts at `scripts` directory.\n- To train and test pix2pix-based colorization models, please add `--model colorization` and `--dataset_mode colorization`. See our training [tips](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/docs/tips.md#notes-on-colorization) for more details.\n\n### Apply a pre-trained model (CycleGAN)\n\n- You can download a pretrained model (e.g. horse2zebra) with the following script:\n\n```bash\nbash ./scripts/download_cyclegan_model.sh horse2zebra\n```\n\n- The pretrained model is saved at `./checkpoints/{name}_pretrained/latest_net_G.pth`. Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_cyclegan_model.sh#L3) for all the available CycleGAN models.\n- To test the model, you also need to download the horse2zebra dataset:\n\n```bash\nbash ./datasets/download_cyclegan_dataset.sh horse2zebra\n```\n\n- Then generate the results using\n\n```bash\npython test.py --dataroot datasets/horse2zebra/testA --name horse2zebra_pretrained --model test --no_dropout\n```\n\n- The option `--model test` is used for generating results of CycleGAN only for one side. This option will automatically set `--dataset_mode single`, which only loads the images from one set. On the contrary, using `--model cycle_gan` requires loading and generating results in both directions, which is sometimes unnecessary. The results will be saved at `./results/`. Use `--results_dir {directory_path_to_save_result}` to specify the results directory.\n\n- For pix2pix and your own models, you need to explicitly specify `--netG`, `--norm`, `--no_dropout` to match the generator architecture of the trained model. See this [FAQ](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/docs/qa.md#runtimeerror-errors-in-loading-state_dict-812-671461-296) for more details.\n\n### Apply a pre-trained model (pix2pix)\n\nDownload a pre-trained model with `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`.\n\n- Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh#L3) for all the available pix2pix models. For example, if you would like to download label2photo model on the Facades dataset,\n\n```bash\nbash ./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh facades_label2photo\n```\n\n- Download the pix2pix facades datasets:\n\n```bash\nbash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades\n```\n\n- Then generate the results using\n\n```bash\npython test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades/ --direction BtoA --model pix2pix --name facades_label2photo_pretrained\n```\n\n- Note that we specified `--direction BtoA` as Facades dataset''s A to B direction is photos to labels.\n\n- If you would like to apply a pre-trained model to a collection of input images (rather than image pairs), please use `--model test` option. See `./scripts/test_single.sh` for how to apply a model to Facade label maps (stored in the directory `facades/testB`).\n\n- See a list of currently available models at `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`\n\n### Multi-GPU training\n\nTo train a model on multiple GPUs, please use `torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 train.py ...` instead of `python train.py ...`. We also need to use synchronized batchnorm by setting `--norm sync_batch` (or `--norm sync_instance` for instance normgalization). The `--norm batch` is not compatible with DDP.\n\n## [Docker](docs/docker.md)\n\nWe provide the pre-built Docker image and Dockerfile that can run this code repo.

Build and launch using the instructions above.\n2. Click ''Change default saved annotation folder'' in Menu/File\n3. Click ''Open Dir''\n4. Click ''Create RectBox''\n5. Click and release left mouse to select a region to annotate the rect\n   box\n6. You can use right mouse to drag the rect box to copy or move it\n\nThe annotation will be saved to the folder you specify.\n\nYou can refer to the below hotkeys to speed up your workflow.\n\nSteps (YOLO)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1. In ``data/predefined_classes.txt`` define the list of classes that will be used for your training.\n\n2. Build and launch using the instructions above.\n\n3. Right below "Save" button in the toolbar, click "PascalVOC" button to switch to YOLO format.\n\n4. You may use Open/OpenDIR to process single or multiple images. When finished with a single image, click save.\n\nA txt file of YOLO format will be saved in the same folder as your image with same name. A file named "classes.txt" is saved to that folder too. "classes.txt" defines the list of class names that your YOLO label refers to.\n\nNote:\n\n- Your label list shall not change in the middle of processing a list of images. When you save an image, classes.txt will also get updated, while previous annotations will not be updated.\n\n- You shouldn''t use "default class" function when saving to YOLO format, it will not be referred.\n\n- When saving as YOLO format, "difficult" flag is discarded.\n\nCreate pre-defined classes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can edit the\n`data/predefined\_classes.txt <https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg/blob/master/data/predefined_classes.txt>`__\nto load pre-defined classes\n\nAnnotation visualization\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1. Copy the existing lables file to same folder with the images. The labels file name must be same with image file name.\n\n2. Click File and choose ''Open Dir'' then Open the image folder.\n\n3. Select image in File List, it will appear the bounding box and label for all objects in that image.\n\n(Choose Display Labels mode in View to show/hide lablels)\n\n\nHotkeys\n~~~~~~~\n\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + u           | Load all of the images from a directory    |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + r           | Change the default annotation target dir   |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + s           | Save                                       |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + d           | Copy the current label and rect box        |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl + Shift + d   | Delete the current image                   |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Space              | Flag the current image as verified         |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| w                  | Create a rect box                          |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| d                  | Next image                                 |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| a                  | Previous image                             |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| del                | Delete the selected rect box               |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl++             | Zoom in                                    |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Ctrl--             | Zoom out                                   |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n| ↑→↓←               | Keyboard arrows to move selected rect box  |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n\n**Verify Image:**\n\nWhen pressing space, the user can flag the image as verified, a green background will appear.\nThis is used when creating a dataset automatically, the user can then through all the pictures and flag them instead of annotate them.\n\n**Difficult:**\n\nThe difficult field is set to 1 indicates that the object has been annotated as "difficult", for example, an object which is clearly visible but difficult to recognize without substantial use of context.\nAccording to your deep neural network implementation, you can include or exclude difficult objects during training.\n\nHow to reset the settings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn case there are issues with loading the classes, you can either:\n\n1.

The workflow of our system consists of four stages:\n+ **Task Planning**: Using ChatGPT to analyze the requests of users to understand their intention, and disassemble them into possible solvable tasks.\n+ **Model Selection**: To solve the planned tasks, ChatGPT selects expert models hosted on Hugging Face based on their descriptions.\n+ **Task Execution**: Invokes and executes each selected model, and return the results to ChatGPT.\n+ **Response Generation**: Finally, using ChatGPT to integrate the prediction of all models, and generate responses.\n\n<p align="center"><img src="./hugginggpt/assets/overview.jpg"></p>\n\n### System Requirements\n\n#### Default (Recommended)\n\nFor `configs/config.default.yaml`:\n\n+ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n+ VRAM >= 24GB\n+ RAM > 12GB (minimal), 16GB (standard), 80GB (full)\n+ Disk > 284GB \n  + 42GB for `damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b`\n  + 126GB for `ControlNet`\n  + 66GB for `stable-diffusion-v1-5`\n  + 50GB for others\n  \n#### Minimum (Lite)\n\nFor `configs/config.lite.yaml`:\n\n+ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n+ Nothing else\n\nThe configuration `configs/config.lite.yaml` does not require any expert models to be downloaded and deployed locally. However, it means that Jarvis is restricted to models running stably on HuggingFace Inference Endpoints.\n\n### Quick Start\n\nFirst replace `openai.key` and `huggingface.token` in `server/configs/config.default.yaml` with **your personal OpenAI Key** and **your Hugging Face Token**, or put them in the environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN` respectively. Then run the following commands:\n\n<span id="Server"></span>\n\n#### For Server:\n\n```bash\n# setup env\ncd server\nconda create -n jarvis python=3.8\nconda activate jarvis\nconda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# download models. Make sure that `git-lfs` is installed.\ncd models\nbash download.sh # required when `inference_mode` is `local` or `hybrid`. \n\n# run server\ncd ..\npython models_server.py --config configs/config.default.yaml # required when `inference_mode` is `local` or `hybrid`\npython awesome_chat.py --config configs/config.default.yaml --mode server # for text-davinci-003\n```\n\nNow you can access Jarvis'' services by the Web API. \n\n+ `/hugginggpt` --method `POST`, access the full service.\n+ `/tasks` --method `POST`, access intermediate results for Stage #1.\n+ `/results` --method `POST`, access intermediate results for Stage #1-3.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n# request\ncurl --location ''http://localhost:8004/tasks'' \\n--header ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n--data ''{\n    "messages": [\n        {\n            "role": "user",\n            "content": "based on pose of /examples/d.jpg and content of /examples/e.jpg, please show me a new image"\n        }\n    ]\n}''\n\n# response\n[{"args":{"image":"/examples/d.jpg"},"dep":[-1],"id":0,"task":"openpose-control"},{"args":{"image":"/examples/e.jpg"},"dep":[-1],"id":1,"task":"image-to-text"},{"args":{"image":"<GENERATED>-0","text":"<GENERATED>-1"},"dep":[1,0],"id":2,"task":"openpose-text-to-image"}]\n```\n\n\n#### For Web:\n\nWe provide a user-friendly web page. After starting `awesome_chat.py` in a server mode, you can run the commands to communicate with Jarvis in your browser:\n \n- you need to install `nodejs` and `npm` first.\n- [ IMPORTANT ] if you are running the web client on another machine, you need set `http://{LAN_IP_of_the_server}:{port}/` to `HUGGINGGPT_BASE_URL` of `web/src/config/index.ts`.\n- if you want to use the video generation feature, you need to compile `ffmpeg` manually with H.264.\n- you can switch to ChatGPT by `double click` on the setting icon!\n\n```bash\ncd web\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n```bash\n# Optional: Install ffmpeg\n# This command need be executed without errors.\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 output.mp4\n```\n\n<span id="Gradio"></span>\n\n#### For Gradio\n\nThe Gradio demo is now hosted on Hugging Face Space. You can also run the following commands to start the demo locally:\n\n```bash\npython models_server.py --config configs/config.gradio.yaml\npython run_gradio_demo.py --config configs/config.gradio.yaml\n\n# or run the HF Space as a Docker image (Build with `inference_mode=hibrid` and `local_deployment=standard`)\ndocker run -it -p 7860:7860 --platform=linux/amd64 registry.hf.space/microsoft-hugginggpt:latest python app.py\n```\n\n#### For CLI:\n\nYou can also run Jarvis more easily in CLI mode:\n\n```bash\ncd server\npython awesome_chat.py --config configs/config.default.yaml --mode cli\n```\n\nExamples of CLI mode:\n\n```\nWelcome to Jarvis! A collaborative system that consists of an LLM as the controller and numerous expert models as collaborative executors. Jarvis can plan tasks, schedule Hugging Face models, generate friendly responses based on your requests, and help you with many things. Please enter your request (`exit` to exit).\n[ User ]: Given a collection of image A: /examples/a.jpg, B: /examples/b.jpg, C: /examples/c.jpg, please tell me how many zebras in these picture?\n[ Jarvis ]: Based on your request, I have used several models to process the images you provided. For the image A: /examples/a.jpg, I used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text "a cat sitting on a window sill looking out". Then I used the object-detection model facebook/detr-resnet-50 to generate the image with predicted box ''/images/a3dc.jpg'', which contains two objects with labels ''potted plant'' and ''cat''. For the image B: /examples/b.jpg, I used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text "two zebras standing in a field of dry grass". Then I used the object-detection model facebook/detr-resnet-50 to generate the image with predicted box ''/images/f5df.jpg'', which contains three objects with labels ''zebra''. For the image C: /examples/c.jpg, I used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text "a zebra standing in a field of tall grass". Then I used the object-detection model facebook/detr-resnet-50 to generate the image with predicted box ''/images/69c7.jpg'', which contains one object with label ''zebra''. Finally, I used the canny-control model canny-control to generate the image ''/images/7e18.png'' based on the image /examples/f.jpg. Therefore, there are four zebras in these pictures. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n[ User ]: Please answer all the named entities in the sentence: Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby.\n[ Jarvis ]: Sure, I understand your request. Based on the inference results of the models, I will answer your request step by step. Firstly, I used the token-classification model dslim/bert-base-NER to recognize the named entities in the sentence. The inference result is that the named entities are Iron Man, Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Then, I used the question-answering model deepset/roberta-base-squad2 to answer your request. The inference result is that there is no output since the context cannot be empty. Therefore, I cannot make it. I hope this answer your request. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n[ User ]: Please generate a canny image based on /examples/f.jpg\n[ Jarvis ]: Sure. I have generated a canny image based on /examples/f.jpg. To do this, I first used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text description of the image, which is "a herd of giraffes and zebras grazing in a field". Then I used the canny-control model to generate the canny image of the original image, which is stored in the path "/images/1ea2.png". Finally, I used the canny-text-to-image model lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-canny to generate the canny image based on the text description and the canny image, which is stored in the path "/images/ba66.png". Do you need anything else?\n```\n\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe server-side configuration file is `server/configs/config.default.yaml`, and some parameters are presented as follows:\n\n+ `model`: LLM, currently supports `text-davinci-003`. We are working on integrating more open-source LLMs.\n+ `inference_mode`: mode of inference endpoints\n  + `local`: only use the local inference endpoints\n  + `huggingface`: only use the Hugging Face Inference Endpoints **(free of local inference endpoints)**\n  + `hybrid`: both of `local` and `huggingface`\n+ `local_deployment`: scale of locally deployed models, works under `local` or `hybrid` inference mode:\n  +  `minimal` (RAM>12GB, ControlNet only)\n  +  `standard` (RAM>16GB, ControlNet + Standard Pipelines)\n  +  `full` (RAM>42GB, All registered models)\n\nOn a personal laptop, we recommend the configuration of `inference_mode: hybrid `and `local_deployment: minimal`. But the available models under this setting may be limited due to the instability of remote Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.\n\n### NVIDIA Jetson Embedded Device Support\nA [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile.jetson) is included that provides experimental support for [NVIDIA Jetson embedded devices](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing).  This image provides accelerated ffmpeg, pytorch, torchaudio, and torchvision dependencies.  To build the docker image, [ensure that the default docker runtime is set to ''nvidia''](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Advanced-topics#default-runtime).  A pre-built image is provided at https://hub.docker.com/r/toolboc/nv-jarvis.\n\n```bash\n#Build the docker image\ndocker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile.jetson" -t toolboc/nv-jarvis:r35.2.1 \n```\n\nDue to to memory requirements, JARVIS is required to run on Jetson AGX Orin family devices (64G on-board RAM device preferred) with config options set to:\n* `inference_mode: local` \n* `local_deployment: standard`  \n\nModels and configs are recommended to be provided through a volume mount from the host to the container as shown in the `docker run` step below.  It is possible to uncomment the `# Download local models` section of the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile.jetson) to build a container with models included.\n\n#### Start the model server, awesomechat, and web app on Jetson Orin AGX\n\n```bash\n# run the container which will automatically start the model server\ndocker run --name jarvis --net=host --gpus all -v ~/jarvis/configs:/app/server/configs -v ~/src/JARVIS/server/models:/app/server/models toolboc/nv-jarvis:r35.2.1\n\n# (wait for model server to complete initialization)\n\n# start awesome_chat.py \ndocker exec jarvis python3 awesome_chat.py --config configs/config.default.yaml --mode server\n\n#start the web application (application will be acessible at http://localhost:9999)\ndocker exec jarvis npm run dev --prefix=/app/web\n```\n\n### Screenshots\n\n<p align="center"><img src="./hugginggpt/assets/screenshot_q.jpg"><img src="./hugginggpt/assets/screenshot_a.jpg"></p>\n\n\n\n\n## Citation\nIf you find this work useful in your method, you can cite the paper as below:\n\n    @inproceedings{shen2023hugginggpt,\n      author = {Shen, Yongliang and Song, Kaitao and Tan, Xu and Li, Dongsheng and Lu, Weiming and Zhuang, Yueting},\n      booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n      title = {HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace},\n      year = {2023}\n    }\n\n>\n    @article{shen2023taskbench,\n      title   = {TaskBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Task Automation},\n      author  = {Shen, Yongliang and Song, Kaitao and Tan, Xu and Zhang, Wenqi and Ren, Kan and Yuan, Siyu and Lu, Weiming and Li, Dongsheng and Zhuang, Yueting},\n      journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.18760},\n      year    = {2023}\n    }\n\n>\n    @article{yuan2024easytool,\n      title   = {EASYTOOL: Enhancing LLM-based Agents with Concise Tool Instruction},\n      author  = {Siyu Yuan and Kaitao Song and Jiangjie Chen and Xu Tan and Yongliang Shen and Ren Kan and Dongsheng Li and Deqing Yang},\n      journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.06201},\n      year    = {2024}\n    }\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":24485,"forks":2057,"watchers":24485,"open_issues":521,"topics":["deep-learning","platform","pytorch"],"default_branch":"main","size_kb":41674,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:langchain-ai:langchain","source_url":"https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:NVIDIA:nvidia-docker","source_url":"https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 80, '369e288e7826121d407a77ded6f13ddb', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

for New Users](#quick-tour-for-new-users)\n- [Architecture Overview](#architecture-overview)\n- [Implemented GNN Models](#implemented-gnn-models)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n\n## Library Highlights\n\nWhether you are a machine learning researcher or first-time user of machine learning toolkits, here are some reasons to try out PyG for machine learning on graph-structured data.\n\n- **Easy-to-use and unified API**:\n  All it takes is 10-20 lines of code to get started with training a GNN model (see the next section for a [quick tour](#quick-tour-for-new-users)).\n  PyG is *PyTorch-on-the-rocks*: It utilizes a tensor-centric API and keeps design principles close to vanilla PyTorch.\n  If you are already familiar with PyTorch, utilizing PyG is straightforward.\n- **Comprehensive and well-maintained GNN models**:\n  Most of the state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network architectures have been implemented by library developers or authors of research papers and are ready to be applied.\n- **Great flexibility**:\n  Existing PyG models can easily be extended for conducting your own research with GNNs.\n  Making modifications to existing models or creating new architectures is simple, thanks to its easy-to-use message passing API, and a variety of operators and utility functions.\n- **Large-scale real-world GNN models**:\n  We focus on the need of GNN applications in challenging real-world scenarios, and support learning on diverse types of graphs, including but not limited to: scalable GNNs for graphs with millions of nodes; dynamic GNNs for node predictions over time; heterogeneous GNNs with multiple node types and edge types.\n\n## Quick Tour for New Users\n\nIn this quick tour, we highlight the ease of creating and training a GNN model with only a few lines of code.\n\n### Train your own GNN model\n\nIn the first glimpse of PyG, we implement the training of a GNN for classifying papers in a citation graph.\nFor this, we load the [Cora](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.Planetoid.html) dataset, and create a simple 2-layer GCN model using the pre-defined [`GCNConv`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.GCNConv.html):\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv\nfrom torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid\n\ndataset = Planetoid(root=''.'', name=''Cora'')\n\nclass GCN(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv1 = GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)\n        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, out_channels)\n\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor, edge_index: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # x: Node feature matrix of shape [num_nodes, in_channels]\n        # edge_index: Graph connectivity matrix of shape [2, num_edges]\n        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index).relu()\n        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)\n        return x\n\nmodel = GCN(dataset.num_features, 16, dataset.num_classes)\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>We can now optimize the model in a training loop, similar to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/optimization_tutorial.html#full-implementation">standard PyTorch training procedure</a>.</summary>\n\n```python\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndata = dataset[0]\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n\nfor epoch in range(200):\n    pred = model(data.x, data.edge_index)\n    loss = F.cross_entropy(pred[data.train_mask], data.y[data.train_mask])\n\n    # Backpropagation\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n```\n\n</details>\n\nMore information about evaluating final model performance can be found in the corresponding [example](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/gcn.py).\n\n### Create your own GNN layer\n\nIn addition to the easy application of existing GNNs, PyG makes it simple to implement custom Graph Neural Networks (see [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/create_gnn.html) for the accompanying tutorial).\nFor example, this is all it takes to implement the [edge convolutional layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07829) from Wang *et al.*:\n\n$$x_i^{\\prime} ~ = ~ \\max\_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} ~ \\textrm{MLP}\_{\\theta} \\left( [ ~ x_i, ~ x_j - x_i ~ ] \\right)$$\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torch.nn import Sequential, Linear, ReLU\nfrom torch_geometric.nn import MessagePassing\n\nclass EdgeConv(MessagePassing):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):\n        super().__init__(aggr="max")  # "Max" aggregation.\n        self.mlp = Sequential(\n            Linear(2 * in_channels, out_channels),\n            ReLU(),\n            Linear(out_channels, out_channels),\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor, edge_index: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # x: Node feature matrix of shape [num_nodes, in_channels]\n        # edge_index: Graph connectivity matrix of shape [2, num_edges]\n        return self.propagate(edge_index, x=x)  # shape [num_nodes, out_channels]\n\n    def message(self, x_j: Tensor, x_i: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # x_j: Source node features of shape [num_edges, in_channels]\n        # x_i: Target node features of shape [num_edges, in_channels]\n        edge_features = torch.cat([x_i, x_j - x_i], dim=-1)\n        return self.mlp(edge_features)  # shape [num_edges, out_channels]\n```\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nPyG provides a multi-layer framework that enables users to build Graph Neural Network solutions on both low and high levels.\nIt comprises of the following components:\n\n- The PyG **engine** utilizes the powerful PyTorch deep learning framework with full [`torch.compile`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/compile.html) and [TorchScript](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/jit.html) support, as well as additions of efficient CPU/CUDA libraries for operating on sparse data, *e.g.*, [`pyg-lib`](https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib).\n- The PyG **storage** handles data processing, transformation and loading pipelines. It is capable of handling and processing large-scale graph datasets, and provides effective solutions for heterogeneous graphs. It further provides a variety of sampling solutions, which enable training of GNNs on large-scale graphs.\n- The PyG **operators** bundle essential functionalities for implementing Graph Neural Networks. PyG supports important GNN building blocks that can be combined and applied to various parts of a GNN model, ensuring rich flexibility of GNN design.\n- Finally, PyG provides an abundant set of GNN **models**, and examples that showcase GNN models on standard graph benchmarks. Thanks to its flexibility, users can easily build and modify custom GNN models to fit their specific needs.\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="100%"

models, layers and operators according to category:\n\n**GNN layers:**\nAll Graph Neural Network layers are implemented via the **[`nn.MessagePassing`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.MessagePassing.html)** interface.\nA GNN layer specifies how to perform message passing, *i.e.* by designing different message, aggregation and update functions as defined [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/create_gnn.html).\nThese GNN layers can be stacked together to create Graph Neural Network models.\n\n- **[GCNConv](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.GCNConv.html)** from Kipf and Welling:

Networks that can scale to large-scale graphs.\nSuch application is challenging since the entire graph, its associated features and the GNN parameters cannot fit into GPU memory.\nMany state-of-the-art scalability approaches tackle this challenge by sampling neighborhoods for mini-batch training, graph clustering and partitioning, or by using simplified GNN models.\nThese approaches have been implemented in PyG, and can benefit from the above GNN layers, operators and models.\n\n-

Installation\n\nPyG is available for Python 3.10 to Python 3.13.\n\nFrom **PyG 2.3** onwards, you can install and use PyG **without any external library** required except for PyTorch.\nFor this, simply run\n\n```\npip install torch_geometric\n```\n\n### Additional Libraries\n\nIf you want to utilize the full set of features from PyG, there exists several additional libraries you may want to install:\n\n- **[`pyg-lib`](https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib)**: Heterogeneous GNN operators and graph sampling routines\n- **[`torch-scatter`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter)**: Accelerated and efficient sparse reductions\n- **[`torch-sparse`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_sparse)**:

based on the [PyTorch C++/CUDA/hip(ROCm) extension interface](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp).\nFor a basic usage of PyG, these dependencies are **fully optional**.\nWe recommend to start with a minimal installation, and install additional dependencies once you start to actually need them.\n\nFor ease of installation of these extensions, we provide `pip` wheels for all major OS/PyTorch/CUDA combinations, see [here](https://data.pyg.org/whl).\n\n#### PyTorch 2.8\n\nTo install the binaries for PyTorch 2.8.0, simply run\n\n```\npip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse

The audio is decoded with the Python library [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) which bundles the FFmpeg libraries in its package.\n\n### GPU\n\nGPU execution requires the following NVIDIA libraries to be installed:\n\n* [cuBLAS for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas)\n* [cuDNN 9 for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)\n\n**Note**: The latest versions of `ctranslate2` only support CUDA 12 and cuDNN 9. For CUDA 11 and cuDNN 8, the current workaround is downgrading to the `3.24.0` version of `ctranslate2`, for CUDA 12 and cuDNN 8, downgrade to the `4.4.0` version of `ctranslate2`, (This can be done with `pip install --force-reinstall ctranslate2==4.4.0` or specifying the version in a `requirements.txt`).\n\nThere are multiple ways to install the NVIDIA libraries mentioned above. The recommended way is described in the official NVIDIA documentation, but we also suggest other installation methods below. \n\n<details>\n<summary>Other installation methods (click to expand)</summary>\n\n\n**Note:** For all these methods below, keep in mind the above note regarding CUDA versions. Depending on your setup, you may need to install the _CUDA 11_ versions of libraries that correspond to the CUDA 12 libraries listed in the instructions below.\n\n#### Use Docker\n\nThe libraries (cuBLAS, cuDNN) are installed in this official NVIDIA CUDA Docker images: `nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-cudnn9-runtime-ubuntu22.04`.\n\n#### Install with `pip` (Linux only)\n\nOn Linux these libraries can be installed with `pip`. Note that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` must be set before launching Python.\n\n```bash\npip install nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12==9.*\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`python3 -c ''import os; import nvidia.cublas.lib; import nvidia.cudnn.lib; print(os.path.dirname(nvidia.cublas.lib.__file__) + ":" + os.path.dirname(nvidia.cudnn.lib.__file__))''`\n```\n\n#### Download the libraries from Purfview''s repository (Windows & Linux)\n\nPurfview''s [whisper-standalone-win](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win) provides the required NVIDIA libraries for Windows & Linux in a [single archive](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases/tag/libs). Decompress the archive and place the libraries in a directory included in the `PATH`.\n\n</details>\n\n## Installation\n\nThe module can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/faster-whisper/):\n\n```bash\npip install faster-whisper\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Other installation methods (click to expand)</summary>\n\n### Install the master branch\n\n```bash\npip install --force-reinstall "faster-whisper @ https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz"\n```\n\n### Install a specific commit\n\n```bash\npip install --force-reinstall "faster-whisper @ https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/archive/a4f1cc8f11433e454c3934442b5e1a4ed5e865c3.tar.gz"\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Usage\n\n### Faster-whisper\n\n```python\nfrom faster_whisper import WhisperModel\n\nmodel_size = "large-v3"\n\n# Run on GPU with FP16\nmodel = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")\n\n# or run on GPU with INT8\n# model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="int8_float16")\n# or run on CPU with INT8\n# model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cpu", compute_type="int8")\n\nsegments, info = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", beam_size=5)\n\nprint("Detected language ''%s'' with probability %f" % (info.language, info.language_probability))\n\nfor segment in segments:\n    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))\n```\n\n**Warning:** `segments` is a *generator* so the transcription only starts when you iterate over it. The transcription can be run to completion by gathering the segments in a list or a `for` loop:\n\n```python\nsegments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3")\nsegments = list(segments)  # The transcription will actually run here.\n```\n\n### Batched Transcription\nThe following code snippet illustrates how to run batched transcription on an example audio file. `BatchedInferencePipeline.transcribe` is a drop-in replacement for `WhisperModel.transcribe`\n\n```python\nfrom faster_whisper import WhisperModel, BatchedInferencePipeline\n\nmodel = WhisperModel("turbo", device="cuda", compute_type="float16")\nbatched_model = BatchedInferencePipeline(model=model)\nsegments, info = batched_model.transcribe("audio.mp3", batch_size=16)\n\nfor segment in segments:\n    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))\n```\n\n### Faster Distil-Whisper\n\nThe Distil-Whisper checkpoints are compatible with the Faster-Whisper package. In particular, the latest [distil-large-v3](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v3)\ncheckpoint is intrinsically designed to work with the Faster-Whisper transcription algorithm. The following code snippet \ndemonstrates how to run inference with distil-large-v3 on a specified audio file:\n\n```python\nfrom faster_whisper import WhisperModel\n\nmodel_size = "distil-large-v3"\n\nmodel = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")\nsegments, info = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", beam_size=5, language="en", condition_on_previous_text=False)\n\nfor segment in segments:\n    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))\n```\n\nFor more information about the distil-large-v3 model, refer to the original [model card](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v3).\n\n### Word-level timestamps\n\n```python\nsegments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", word_timestamps=True)\n\nfor segment in segments:\n    for word in segment.words:\n        print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (word.start, word.end, word.word))\n```\n\n### VAD filter\n\nThe library integrates the [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) model to filter out parts of the audio without speech:\n\n```python\nsegments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", vad_filter=True)\n```\n\nThe default behavior is conservative and only removes silence longer than 2 seconds. See the available VAD parameters and default values in the [source code](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/blob/master/faster_whisper/vad.py). They can be customized with the dictionary argument `vad_parameters`:\n\n```python\nsegments, _ = model.transcribe(\n    "audio.mp3",\n    vad_filter=True,\n    vad_parameters=dict(min_silence_duration_ms=500),\n)\n```\nVad filter is enabled by default for batched transcription.\n\n### Logging\n\nThe library logging level can be configured like this:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig()\nlogging.getLogger("faster_whisper").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\n\n### Going further\n\nSee more model and transcription options in the [`WhisperModel`](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/blob/master/faster_whisper/transcribe.py) class implementation.\n\n## Community integrations\n\nHere is a non exhaustive list of open-source projects using faster-whisper. Feel free to add your project to the list!\n\n\n* [speaches](https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches) is an OpenAI compatible server using `faster-whisper`. It''s easily deployable with Docker, works with OpenAI SDKs/CLI, supports streaming, and live transcription.\n* [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) is an award-winning Python library that offers speaker diarization and accurate word-level timestamps using wav2vec2 alignment\n* [whisper-ctranslate2](https://github.com/Softcatala/whisper-ctranslate2) is a command line client based on faster-whisper and compatible with the original client from openai/whisper.\n* [whisper-diarize](https://github.com/MahmoudAshraf97/whisper-diarization) is a speaker diarization tool that is based on faster-whisper and NVIDIA NeMo.\n* [whisper-standalone-win](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win) Standalone CLI executables of faster-whisper for Windows, Linux & macOS. \n* [asr-sd-pipeline](https://github.com/hedrergudene/asr-sd-pipeline) provides a scalable, modular, end to end multi-speaker speech to text solution implemented using AzureML pipelines.\n* [Open-Lyrics](https://github.com/zh-plus/Open-Lyrics) is a Python library that transcribes voice files using faster-whisper, and translates/polishes the resulting text into `.lrc` files in the desired language using OpenAI-GPT.\n* [wscribe](https://github.com/geekodour/wscribe) is a flexible transcript generation tool supporting faster-whisper, it can export word level transcript and the exported transcript then can be edited with [wscribe-editor](https://github.com/geekodour/wscribe-editor)\n* [aTrain](https://github.com/BANDAS-Center/aTrain) is a graphical user interface implementation of faster-whisper developed at the BANDAS-Center at the University of Graz for transcription and diarization in Windows ([Windows Store App](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/atrain/9N15Q44SZNS2)) and Linux.\n* [Whisper-Streaming](https://github.com/ufal/whisper_streaming) implements real-time mode for offline Whisper-like speech-to-text models with faster-whisper as the most recommended back-end. It implements a streaming policy with self-adaptive latency based on the actual source complexity, and demonstrates the state of the art.\n* [WhisperLive](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive) is a nearly-live implementation of OpenAI''s Whisper which uses faster-whisper as the backend to transcribe audio in real-time.\n* [Faster-Whisper-Transcriber](https://github.com/BBC-Esq/ctranslate2-faster-whisper-transcriber) is a simple but reliable voice transcriber that provides a user-friendly interface.\n* [Open-dubbing](https://github.com/softcatala/open-dubbing) is open dubbing is an AI dubbing system which uses machine learning models to automatically translate and synchronize audio dialogue into different languages.\n* [Whisper-FastAPI](https://github.com/heimoshuiyu/whisper-fastapi) whisper-fastapi is a very simple script that provides an API backend compatible with OpenAI, HomeAssistant, and Konele (Android voice typing) formats.\n\n## Model conversion\n\nWhen loading a model from its size such as `WhisperModel("large-v3")`, the corresponding CTranslate2 model is automatically downloaded from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/Systran).\n\nWe also provide a script to convert any Whisper models compatible with the Transformers library. They could be the original OpenAI models or user fine-tuned models.\n\nFor example the command below converts the [original "large-v3" Whisper model](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) and saves the weights in FP16:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers[torch]>=4.23\n\nct2-transformers-converter --model openai/whisper-large-v3 --output_dir whisper-large-v3-ct2\n--copy_files tokenizer.json preprocessor_config.json --quantization float16\n```\n\n* The option `--model` accepts a model name on the Hub or a path to a model directory.\n* If the option `--copy_files tokenizer.json` is not used, the tokenizer configuration is automatically downloaded when the model is loaded later.\n\nModels can also be converted from the code. See the [conversion API](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/python/ctranslate2.converters.TransformersConverter.html).\n\n### Load a converted model\n\n1. Directly load the model from a local directory:\n```python\nmodel = faster_whisper.WhisperModel("whisper-large-v3-ct2")\n```\n\n2. [Upload your model to the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_sharing#upload-with-the-web-interface) and load it from its name:\n```python\nmodel = faster_whisper.WhisperModel("username/whisper-large-v3-ct2")\n```\n\n## Comparing performance against other implementations\n\nIf you are comparing the performance against other Whisper implementations, you should make sure to run the comparison with similar settings. In particular:\n\n* Verify that the same transcription options are used, especially the same beam size. For example in openai/whisper, `model.transcribe` uses a default beam size of 1 but here we use a default beam size of 5.\n* Transcription speed is closely affected by the number of words in the transcript, so ensure that other implementations have a similar WER (Word Error Rate) to this one.\n* When running on CPU, make sure to set the same number of threads. Many frameworks will read the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, which can be set when running your script:\n\n```bash\nOMP_NUM_THREADS=4 python3 my_script.py\n```\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":19366,"forks":1610,"watchers":19366,"open_issues":294,"topics":["deep-learning","inference","openai","quantization","speech-recognition","speech-to-text","transformer","whisper"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":40514,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:OpenNMT:CTranslate2","source_url":"https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggerganov:whisper.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ggerganov:whisper.cpp","source_url":"https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:huggingface:transformers","source_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:PyAV-Org:PyAV","source_url":"https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Purfview:whisper-standalone-win","source_url":"https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Purfview:whisper-standalone-win","source_url":"https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:snakers4:silero-vad","source_url":"https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:SYSTRAN:faster-whisper","source_url":"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:speaches-ai:speaches","source_url":"https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:m-bain:whisperX","source_url":"https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Softcatala:whisper-ctranslate2","source_url":"https://github.com/Softcatala/whisper-ctranslate2"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:MahmoudAshraf97:whisper-diarization","source_url":"https://github.com/MahmoudAshraf97/whisper-diarization"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Purfview:whisper-standalone-win","source_url":"https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:hedrergudene:asr-sd-pipeline","source_url":"https://github.com/hedrergudene/asr-sd-pipeline"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:zh-plus:Open-Lyrics","source_url":"https://github.com/zh-plus/Open-Lyrics"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:geekodour:wscribe","source_url":"https://github.com/geekodour/wscribe"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:geekodour:wscribe-editor","source_url":"https://github.com/geekodour/wscribe-editor"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:BANDAS-Center:aTrain","source_url":"https://github.com/BANDAS-Center/aTrain"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ufal:whisper_streaming","source_url":"https://github.com/ufal/whisper_streaming"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:collabora:WhisperLive","source_url":"https://github.com/collabora/WhisperLive"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:BBC-Esq:ctranslate2-faster-whisper-transcriber","source_url":"https://github.com/BBC-Esq/ctranslate2-faster-whisper-transcriber"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:softcatala:open-dubbing","source_url":"https://github.com/softcatala/open-dubbing"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:heimoshuiyu:whisper-fastapi","source_url":"https://github.com/heimoshuiyu/whisper-fastapi"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 80, 'd320e66d3ef8f69fbf01257efd04ad5d', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

notebook代码（基于PyTorch）；docs文件夹就是markdown格式的《动手学深度学习》书中的相关内容，然后利用[docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/zh-cn/)将网页文档部署到GitHub Pages上，由于原书使用的是MXNet框架，所以docs内容可能与原书略有不同，但是整体内容是一样的。欢迎对本项目做出贡献或提出issue。\n\n## 面向人群\n本项目面向对深度学习感兴趣，尤其是想使用PyTorch进行深度学习的童鞋。本项目并不要求你有任何深度学习或者机器学习的背景知识，你只需了解基础的数学和编程，如基础的线性代数、微分和概率，以及基础的Python编程。\n\n## 食用方法 \n### 方法一\n本仓库包含一些latex公式，但github的markdown原生是不支持公式显示的，而docs文件夹已经利用[docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/zh-cn/)被部署到了GitHub Pages上，所以查看文档最简便的方法就是直接访问[本项目网页版](https://tangshusen.me/Dive-into-DL-PyTorch)。当然如果你还想跑一下运行相关代码的话还是得把本项目clone下来，然后运行code文件夹下相关代码。\n\n### 方法二\n你还可以在本地访问文档，先安装`docsify-cli`工具:\n``` shell\nnpm i docsify-cli -g\n```\n然后将本项目clone到本地:\n``` shell\ngit clone https://github.com/ShusenTang/Dive-into-DL-PyTorch.git\ncd Dive-into-DL-PyTorch\n```\n然后运行一个本地服务器，这样就可以很方便的在`http://localhost:3000`实时访问文档网页渲染效果。\n``` shell\ndocsify serve docs\n```\n\n### 方法三\n如果你不想安装`docsify-cli`工具，甚至你的电脑上都没有安装`Node.js`，而出于某些原因你又想在本地浏览文档，那么你可以在`docker`容器中运行网页服务。\n\n首先将本项目clone到本地:\n``` shell\ngit clone https://github.com/ShusenTang/Dive-into-DL-PyTorch.git\ncd Dive-into-DL-PyTorch\n```\n之后使用如下命令创建一个名称为「d2dl」的`docker`镜像：\n``` shell\ndocker build -t d2dl .\n```\n镜像创建好后，运行如下命令创建一个新的容器：\n``` shell\ndocker run -dp 3000:3000 d2dl\n```\n最后在浏览器中打开这个地址`http://localhost:3000/#/`，就能愉快地访问文档了。适合那些不想在电脑上装太多工具的小伙伴。\n\n\n## 目录\n* [简介]()\n* [阅读指南](read_guide.md)\n* [1. 深度学习简介](chapter01_DL-intro/deep-learning-intro.md)\n* 2\. 预备知识\n

Over the last few years we have been privileged to develop such key open-source machine learning projects, including the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, which has enabled its users to leverage industry-wide advancements in deep learning at scale. \n\nToday’s 2.7 release will be the last main release of CNTK. We may have some subsequent minor releases for bug fixes, but these will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. There are no plans for new feature development post this release. \n\nThe CNTK 2.7 release has full support for ONNX 1.4.1, and we encourage those seeking to operationalize their CNTK models to take advantage of ONNX and the ONNX Runtime. Moving forward, users can continue to leverage evolving ONNX innovations via the number of frameworks that support it. For example, users can natively export ONNX models from PyTorch or convert TensorFlow models to ONNX with the TensorFlow-ONNX converter. \n\nWe are incredibly grateful for all the support we have received from contributors and users over the years since the initial open-source release of CNTK. CNTK has enabled both Microsoft teams and external users to execute complex and large-scale workloads in all manner of deep learning applications, such as historical breakthroughs in speech recognition achieved by Microsoft Speech researchers, the originators of the framework. \n\nAs ONNX is increasingly employed in serving models used across Microsoft products such as Bing and Office, we are dedicated to synthesizing innovations from research with the rigorous demands of production to progress the ecosystem forward. \n\nAbove all, our goal is to make innovations in deep learning across the software and hardware stacks as open and accessible as possible. We will be working hard to bring both the existing strengths of CNTK and new state-of-the-art research into other open-source projects to truly broaden the reach of such technologies. \n\nWith gratitude, \n\n-- The CNTK Team \n\n## Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n\n## News\n\n> You can find more news on [the official project feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/news)\n\n***2019-03-29.*** CNTK 2.7.0\n## Highlights of this release\n* Moved to CUDA 10 for both Windows and Linux.\n* Support advance RNN loop in ONNX export.\n* Export larger than 2GB models in ONNX format.\n* Support FP16 in Brain Script train action.\n\n## CNTK support for CUDA 10\n\n### CNTK now supports CUDA 10. This requires an update to build environment to Visual Studio 2017 v15.9 for Windows.\n\nTo setup build and runtime environment on Windows:\n* Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Note: going forward for CUDA 10 and beyond, it is no longer required to install and run with the specific VC Tools version 14.11.\n* Install [Nvidia CUDA 10](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64)\n* From PowerShell, run:\n    [DevInstall.ps1](../Tools/devInstall/Windows/DevInstall.ps1)\n* Start Visual Studio 2017 and open [CNTK.sln](./CNTK.sln).\n\nTo setup build and runtime environment on Linux using docker, please build Unbuntu 16.04 docker image using Dockerfiles [here](./Tools/docker). For other Linux systems, please refer to the Dockerfiles to setup dependent libraries for CNTK.\n\n## Support advance RNN loop in ONNX export\nCNTK models with recursive loops can be exported to ONNX models with scan ops.\n\n## Export larger than 2GB models in ONNX format\nTo export models larger than 2GB in ONNX format, use cntk.Function API:\nsave(self, filename, format=ModelFormat.CNTKv2, use_external_files_to_store_parameters=False)\nwith ''format'' set to ModelFormat.ONNX and use_external_files_to_store_parameters set to True.\nIn this case, model parameters are saved in external files. Exported models shall be used with external parameter files when doing model evaluation with onnxruntime.\n\n***2018-11-26.***  \n[Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) now supports visualizing CNTK v1 and CNTK v2 `.model` files.\n\n<img src=https://cntk.ai/Images/netron/netron-cntk-dark-1.png alt="NetronCNTKDark1" width="300"> <img src=https://cntk.ai/Images/netron/netron-cntk-light-1.png alt="NetronCNTKLight1" width="300">\n\n\n### Project changelog\n\n***2018-09-17.*** CNTK 2.6.0\n## Efficient group convolution\nThe implementation of group convolution in CNTK has been updated. The updated implementation moves away from creating a sub-graph for group convolution (using slicing and splicing), and instead uses cuDNN7 and MKL2017 APIs directly. This improves the experience both in terms of performance and model size. \n\nAs an example, for a single group convolution op with the following attributes:\n\n- Input tensor (C, H, W) = (32, 128, 128)\n- Number of output channels = 32 (channel multiplier is 1)\n- Groups = 32 (depth wise convolution)\n- Kernel size = (5, 5)\n\nThe comparison numbers for this single node are as follows:\n\n| First Header  | GPU exec. time (in millisec., 1000 run avg.) | CPU exec. time (in millisec., 1000 run avg.) | Model Size (in KB, CNTK format)\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| Old implementation  | 9.349  | 41.921  | 38  |\n| New implementation  | 6.581  | 9.963  | 5  |\n| Speedup/savings   Approx.  | 30%  Approx.  | 65-75%   Approx.  | 87% |\n\n## Sequential Convolution\nThe implementation of sequential convolution in CNTK has been updated. The updated implementation creates a separate sequential convolution layer. Different from regular convolution layer, this operation convolves also on the dynamic axis(sequence), and filter_shape[0] is applied to that axis. The updated implementation supports broader cases, such as where stride > 1 for the sequence axis.\n\nFor example, a sequential convolution over a batch of one-channel black-and-white images. The images have the same fixed height of 640, but each with width of variable lengths. The width is then represented by sequential axis. Padding is enabled, and strides for both width and height are 2.\n\n     >>> f = SequentialConvolution((3,3), reduction_rank=0, pad=True, strides=(2,2), activation=C.relu)\n     >>> x = C.input_variable(**Sequence[Tensor[640]])\n     >>> x.shape\n         (640,)\n     >>> h = f(x)\n     >>> h.shape\n         (320,)\n     >>> f.W.shape\n         (1, 1, 3, 3)\n\n## Operators\n### depth_to_space and space_to_depth\nThere is a breaking change in the **depth_to_space** and **space_to_depth** operators. These have been updated to match ONNX specification, specifically\nthe permutation for how the depth dimension is placed as blocks in the spatial dimensions, and vice-versa, has been changed. Please refer to the updated doc\nexamples for these two ops to see the change.\n\n### Tan and Atan\nAdded support for trigonometric ops `Tan` and `Atan`.\n\n### ELU\nAdded support for `alpha` attribute in ELU op.\n\n### Convolution\nUpdated auto padding algorithms of `Convolution` to produce symmetric padding at best effort on CPU, without affecting the final convolution output values. This update increases the range of cases that could be covered by MKL API and improves the performance, E.g. ResNet50.\n\n## Default arguments order\nThere is a breaking change in the **arguments** property in CNTK python API. The default behavior has been updated to return arguments in python order instead of in C++ order. This way it will return arguments in the same order as they are fed into ops. If you wish to still get arguments in C++ order, you can simply override the global option. This change should only affect the following ops: Times, TransposeTimes, and Gemm(internal). \n\n## Bug fixes\n- Updated doc for Convolution layer to include group and dilation arguments.\n- Added improved input validation for group convolution.\n- Updated `LogSoftMax` to use more numerically stable implementation.\n- Fixed Gather op''s incorrect gradient value.\n- Added validation for ''None'' node in python clone substitution.\n- Added validation for padding channel axis in convolution.\n- Added CNTK native default lotusIR logger to fix the "Attempt to use DefaultLogger" error when loading some ONNX models.\n- Added proper initialization for ONNX TypeStrToProtoMap.\n- Updated python doctest to handle different print format for newer version numpy(version >= 1.14).\n- Fixed Pooling(CPU) to produce correct output values when kernel center is on padded input cells.\n\n## ONNX\n### Updates\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX import/export to use ONNX 1.2 spec.\n- Major update to how batch and sequence axes are handled in export and import. As a result, the complex scenarios and edge cases are handled accurately.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `BatchNormalization` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Added model domain to ONNX model export.\n- Improved error reporting during import and export of ONNX models.\n- Updated `DepthToSpace` and `SpaceToDepth` ops to match ONNX spec on the permutation for how the depth dimension is placed as block dimension.\n- Added support for exporting `alpha` attribute in `ELU` ONNX op.\n- Major overhaul to `Convolution` and `Pooling` export. Unlike before, these ops do not export an explicit `Pad` op in any situation.\n- Major overhaul to `ConvolutionTranspose` export and import. Attributes such as `output_shape`, `output_padding`, and `pads` are fully supported.\n- Added support for CNTK''s `StopGradient` as a no-op.\n- Added ONNX support for TopK op.\n- Added ONNX support for sequence ops: sequence.slice, sequence.first, sequence.last, sequence.reduce_sum, sequence.reduce_max, sequence.softmax. For these ops, there is no need to expand ONNX spec. CNTK ONNX exporter just builds computation equivalent graphs for these sequence ops.\n- Added full support for Softmax op.\n- Made CNTK broadcast ops compatible with ONNX specification.\n- Handle to_batch, to_sequence, unpack_batch, sequence.unpack ops in CNTK ONNX exporter.\n- ONNX tests to export ONNX test cases for other toolkits to run and to validate.\n- Fixed `Hardmax`/`Softmax`/`LogSoftmax` import/export.\n- Added support for `Select` op export.\n- Added import/export support for several trigonometric ops.\n- Updated CNTK support for ONNX `MatMul` op.\n- Updated CNTK support for ONNX `Gemm` op.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `MeanVarianceNormalization` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `LayerNormalization` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `PRelu` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `Gather` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `ImageScaler` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `Reduce` ops export/import to latest spec.\n- Updated CNTK''s ONNX `Flatten` op export/import to latest spec.\n- Added CNTK support for ONNX `Unsqueeze` op.\n\n### Bug or minor fixes:\n- Updated LRN op to match ONNX 1.2 spec where the `size` attribute has the semantics of diameter, not radius. Added validation if LRN kernel size is larger than channel size.\n- Updated `Min`/`Max` import implementation to handle variadic inputs.\n- Fixed possible file corruption when resaving on top of existing ONNX model file.\n\n## .Net Support\nThe Cntk.Core.Managed library has officially been converted to .Net Standard and supports .Net Core and .Net Framework applications on both Windows and Linux. Starting from this release, .Net developers should be able to restore CNTK Nuget packages using new .Net SDK style project file with package management format set to PackageReference.\n\nThe following C# code now works on both Windows and Linux:\n\n     >>> var weightParameterName = "weight";\n	 >>> var biasParameterName = "bias";\n	 >>> var inputName = "input";\n	 >>> var outputDim = 2;\n	 >>> var inputDim = 3;\n	 >>> Variable inputVariable = Variable.InputVariable(new int[] { inputDim }, DataType.Float, inputName);\n	 >>> var weightParameter = new Parameter(new int[] { outputDim, inputDim }, DataType.Float, 1, device, weightParameterName);\n	 >>> var biasParameter = new Parameter(new int[] { outputDim }, DataType.Float, 0, device, biasParameterName);\n	 >>> \n     >>> Function modelFunc = CNTKLib.Times(weightParameter, inputVariable) + biasParameter;\n\nFor example, simply adding an ItemGroup clause in the .csproj file of a .Net Core application is sufficient:\n     >>> <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">\n     >>>\n     >>>   <PropertyGroup>\n     >>>     <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\n     >>>     <Platforms>x64</Platforms>\n     >>>   </PropertyGroup>\n     >>>\n     >>>   <ItemGroup>\n     >>>     <PackageReference Include="CNTK.GPU" Version="2.6.0" />\n     >>>   </ItemGroup>\n     >>>\n     >>> </Project>\n\n### Bug or minor fixes:\n- Fixed C# string and char to native wstring and wchar UTF conversion issues on Linux.\n- Fixed multibyte and wide character conversions across the codebase.\n- Fixed Nuget package mechanism to pack for .Net Standard.\n- Fixed a memory leak issue in Value class in C# API where Dispose was not called upon object destruction.\n\n## Misc\n\n\n***2018-04-16.*** CNTK 2.5.1\n\nRepack CNTK 2.5 with third party libraries included in the bundles (Python wheel packages)\n\n---\n\n***2018-03-15.*** CNTK 2.5\n\nChange profiler details output format to be `chrome://tracing`\n\nEnable per-node timing. Working example [here](/Examples/Image/Classification/MLP/Python/SimpleMNIST.py)\n* per-node timing creates items in profiler details when profiler is enabled.\n* usage in Python:\n\n```python\nimport cntk as C\nC.debugging.debug.set_node_timing(True)\nC.debugging.start_profiler() # optional\nC.debugging.enable_profiler() # optional\n#<trainer|evaluator|function> executions\n<trainer|evaluator|function>.print_node_timing()\nC.debugging.stop_profiler()\n```\n\nExample profiler details view in `chrome://tracing`\n![ProfilerDetailWithNodeTiming](https://cntk.ai/Images/ProfilerDetailWithNodeTiming.jpg)\n\nCPU inference performance improvements using MKL\n* Accelerates some common tensor ops in Intel CPU inference for float32, especially for fully connected networks\n* Can be turned on/off by `cntk.cntk_py.enable_cpueval_optimization()/cntk.cntk_py.disable_cpueval_optimization()`\n\n1BitSGD incorporated into CNTK\n* `1BitSGD` source code is now available with CNTK license (MIT license) under `Source/1BitSGD/`\n* `1bitsgd` build target was merged into existing gpu target\n\nNew loss function: hierarchical softmax\n* Thanks @yaochengji for the contribution!\n\nDistributed Training with Multiple Learners\n* Trainer now accepts multiple parameter learners for distributed training. With this change, different parameters of a network can be learned by different learners in a single training session. This also facilitates distributed training for GANs. For more information, please refer to the [Basic_GAN_Distributed.py](/Examples/Image/GAN/Basic_GAN_Distributed.py) and the [cntk.learners.distributed_multi_learner_test.py](/bindings/python/cntk/learners/tests/distributed_multi_learner_test.py)\n\nOperators\n* Added `MeanVarianceNormalization` operator. \n\nBug fixes\n* Fixed convergence issue in Tutorial 201B\n* Fixed pooling/unpooling to support free dimension for sequences\n* Fixed crash in `CNTKBinaryFormat` deserializer when crossing sweep boundary\n* Fixed shape inference bug in RNN step function for scalar broadcasting\n* Fixed a build bug when `mpi=no`\n* Improved distributed training aggregation speed by increasing packing threshold, and expose the knob in V2\n* Fixed a memory leak in MKL layout\n* Fixed a bug in `cntk.convert` API in `misc.converter.py`, which prevents converting complex networks.\n\nONNX\n* Updates\n    * CNTK exported ONNX models are now `ONNX.checker` compliant. \n    * Added ONNX support for CNTK’s `OptimizedRNNStack` operator (LSTM only).\n    * Added support for LSTM and GRU operators\n    * Added support for experimental ONNX op `MeanVarianceNormalization`.\n    * Added support for experimental ONNX op `Identity`.\n    * Added support for exporting CNTK’s `LayerNormalization` layer using ONNX `MeanVarianceNormalization` op.\n* Bug or minor fixes:\n    * Axis attribute is optional in CNTK’s ONNX `Concat` operator.\n    * Bug fix in ONNX broadcasting for scalars.\n    * Bug fix in ONNX ConvTranspose operator. \n    * Backward compatibility bug fix in `LeakyReLu` (argument ‘alpha’ reverted to type double).\n\nMisc\n* Added a new API `find_by_uid()` under `cntk.logging.graph`. \n\n---\n\n***2018-02-28.*** CNTK supports nightly build\n\nIf you prefer to use latest CNTK bits from master, use one of the CNTK nightly package.\n* [Nightly packages for Windows](https://cntk.ai/nightly-windows.html)\n* [Nightly packages for Linux](https://cntk.ai/nightly-linux.html)\n\nAlternatively, you can also click corresponding build badge to land to nightly build page.\n\n---\n\n***2018-01-31.* CNTK 2.4**\n\nHighlights:\n* Moved to CUDA9, cuDNN 7 and Visual Studio 2017.\n* Removed Python 3.4 support.\n* Added Volta GPU and FP16 support.\n* Better ONNX support.\n* CPU perf improvement.\n* More OPs.\n\nOPs\n* `top_k` operation: in the forward pass it computes the top (largest) k values and corresponding indices along the specified axis. In the backward pass the gradient is scattered to the top k elements (an element not in the top k gets a zero gradient).\n* `gather` operation now supports an axis argument\n* `squeeze` and `expand_dims` operations for easily removing and adding singleton axes\n* `zeros_like` and `ones_like` operations. In many situations you can just rely on CNTK correctly broadcasting a simple 0 or 1 but sometimes you need the actual tensor.\n* `depth_to_space`: Rearranges elements in the input tensor from the depth dimension into spatial blocks. Typical use of this operation is for implementing sub-pixel convolution for some image super-resolution models.\n* `space_to_depth`: Rearranges elements in the input tensor from the spatial dimensions to the depth dimension. It is largely the inverse of DepthToSpace.\n* `sum` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes element-wise sum of input tensors.\n* `softsign` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the element-wise softsign of a input tensor.\n* `asinh` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the element-wise asinh of a input tensor.\n* `log_softmax` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the logsoftmax normalized values of a input tensor.\n* `hard_sigmoid` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the hard_sigmoid normalized values of a input tensor.\n* `element_and`, `element_not`, `element_or`, `element_xor` element-wise logic operations\n* `reduce_l1` operation: Computes the L1 norm of the input tensor''s element along the provided axes.\n* `reduce_l2` operation: Computes the L2 norm of the input tensor''s element along the provided axes.\n* `reduce_sum_square` operation: Computes the sum square of the input tensor''s element along the provided axes.\n* `image_scaler` operation: Alteration of image by scaling its individual values.\n\nONNX\n* There have been several improvements to ONNX support in CNTK.\n* Updates\n  * Updated ONNX `Reshape` op to handle `InferredDimension`.\n  * Adding `producer_name` and `producer_version` fields to ONNX models.\n  * Handling the case when neither `auto_pad` nor `pads` atrribute is specified in ONNX `Conv` op.\n* Bug fixes\n  * Fixed bug in ONNX `Pooling` op serialization\n  * Bug fix to create ONNX `InputVariable` with only one batch axis.\n  * Bug fixes and updates to implementation of ONNX `Transpose` op to match updated spec.\n  * Bug fixes and updates to implementation of ONNX `Conv`, `ConvTranspose`, and `Pooling` ops to match updated spec.\n\nOperators\n* Group convolution\n  * Fixed bug in group convolution. Output of CNTK `Convolution` op will change for groups > 1. More optimized implementation of group convolution is expected in the next release.\n  * Better error reporting for group convolution in `Convolution` layer.\n\nHalide Binary Convolution\n- The CNTK build can now use optional [Halide](http://halide-lang.org/) libraries to build `Cntk.BinaryConvolution.so/dll` library that can be used with the `netopt` module. The library contains optimized binary convolution operators that perform better than the python based binarized convolution operators. To enable Halide in the build, please download [Halide release](https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases) and set `HALIDE_PATH` environment varibale before starting a build. In Linux, you can use `./configure --with-halide[=directory]` to enable it. For more information on how to use this feature, please refer to [How_to_use_network_optimization](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Manual/Manual_How_to_use_network_optimizations.ipynb).\n\nSee more in the [Release Notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_4_Release_Notes).\nGet the Release from the [CNTK Releases page](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/releases).\n', '{"language":"C++","stars":17601,"forks":4262,"watchers":17601,"open_issues":839,"topics":["c-plus-plus","c-sharp","cntk","cognitive-toolkit","deep-learning","deep-neural-networks","distributed","java","machine-learning","neural-network","python"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":935217,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Microsoft:CNTK","source_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:lutzroeder:netron","source_url":"https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:halide:Halide","source_url":"https://github.com/halide/Halide"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Microsoft:CNTK","source_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Microsoft:CNTK","source_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK"}]', NULL, 'NOASSERTION', 'approved', 80, 'c6ecf367a378350939a2af57379e79b1', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
