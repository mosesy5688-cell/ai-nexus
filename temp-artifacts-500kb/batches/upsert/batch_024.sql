There are three interconnected repositories:\n\n1. **[ComfyUI Core](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)**\n   - Releases a new stable version (e.g., v0.7.0) roughly every week.\n   - Commits outside of the stable release tags may be very unstable and break many custom nodes.\n   - Serves as the foundation for the desktop release\n\n2. **[ComfyUI Desktop](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop)**\n   - Builds a new release using the latest stable core version\n\n3. **[ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend)**\n   - Weekly frontend updates are merged into the core repository\n   - Features are frozen for the upcoming core release\n   - Development continues for the next release cycle\n\n## Shortcuts\n\n| Keybind

Installing\n\n## Windows Portable\n\nThere is a portable standalone build for Windows that should work for running on Nvidia GPUs or for running on your CPU only on the [releases page](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases).\n\n### [Direct link to download](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z)\n\nSimply download, extract with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) or with the windows explorer on recent windows versions and run. For smaller models you normally only need to put the checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints but many of the larger models have multiple files. Make sure to follow the instructions to know which subfolder to put them in ComfyUI\models\\n\nIf you have trouble extracting it, right click the file -> properties -> unblock\n\nUpdate your Nvidia drivers if it doesn''t start.\n\n#### Alternative Downloads:\n\n[Experimental portable for AMD GPUs](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_amd.7z)\n\n[Portable with pytorch cuda 12.8 and python 3.12](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu128.7z).\n\n[Portable with pytorch cuda 12.6 and python 3.12](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu126.7z) (Supports Nvidia 10 series and older GPUs).\n\n#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?\n\nSee the [Config file](extra_model_paths.yaml.example) to set the search paths for models. In the standalone windows build you can find this file in the ComfyUI directory. Rename this file to extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.\n\n\n## [comfy-cli](https://docs.comfy.org/comfy-cli/getting-started)\n\nYou can install and start ComfyUI using comfy-cli:\n```bash\npip install comfy-cli\ncomfy install\n```\n\n## Manual Install (Windows, Linux)\n\nPython 3.14 works but you may encounter issues with the torch compile node. The free threaded variant is still missing some dependencies.\n\nPython 3.13 is very well supported. If you have trouble with some custom node dependencies on 3.13 you can try 3.12\n\n### Instructions:\n\nGit clone this repo.\n\nPut your SD checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: models/checkpoints\n\nPut your VAE in: models/vae\n\n\n### AMD GPUs (Linux)\n\nAMD users can install rocm and pytorch with pip if you don''t have it already installed, this is the command to install the stable version:\n\n```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4```\n\nThis is the command to install the nightly with ROCm 7.0 which might have some performance improvements:\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.1```\n\n\n### AMD GPUs (Experimental: Windows and Linux), RDNA 3, 3.5 and 4 only.\n\nThese have less hardware support than the builds above but they work on windows. You also need to install the pytorch version specific to your hardware.\n\nRDNA 3 (RX 7000 series):\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx110X-dgpu/```\n\nRDNA 3.5 (Strix halo/Ryzen AI Max+ 365):\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx1151/```\n\nRDNA 4 (RX 9000 series):\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx120X-all/```\n\n### Intel GPUs (Windows and Linux)\n\nIntel Arc GPU users can install native PyTorch with torch.xpu support using pip. More information can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html)\n\n1. To install PyTorch xpu, use the following command:\n\n```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu```\n\nThis is the command to install the Pytorch xpu nightly which might have some performance improvements:\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/xpu```\n\n### NVIDIA\n\nNvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:\n\n```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130```\n\nThis is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements.\n\n```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130```\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you get the "Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled" error, uninstall torch with:\n\n```pip uninstall torch```\n\nAnd install it again with the command above.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nInstall the dependencies by opening your terminal inside the ComfyUI folder and:\n\n```pip install -r requirements.txt```\n\nAfter this you should have everything installed and can proceed to running ComfyUI.\n\n### Others:\n\n#### Apple Mac silicon\n\nYou can install ComfyUI in Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2) with any recent macOS version.\n\n1. Install pytorch nightly. For instructions, read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly).\n1. Follow the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) instructions for Windows and Linux.\n1. Install the ComfyUI [dependencies](#dependencies). If you have another Stable Diffusion UI [you might be able to reuse the dependencies](#i-already-have-another-ui-for-stable-diffusion-installed-do-i-really-have-to-install-all-of-these-dependencies).\n1. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`\n\n> **Note**: Remember to add your models, VAE, LoRAs etc. to the corresponding Comfy folders, as discussed in [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux).\n\n#### Ascend NPUs\n\nFor models compatible with Ascend Extension for PyTorch (torch_npu). To get started, ensure your environment meets the prerequisites outlined on the [installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/ascend/quick_install.html) page. Here''s a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:\n\n1. Begin by installing the recommended or newer kernel version for Linux as specified in the Installation page of torch-npu, if necessary.\n2. Proceed with the installation of Ascend Basekit, which includes the driver, firmware, and CANN, following the instructions provided for your specific platform.\n3. Next, install the necessary packages for torch-npu by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/pytorch/install.html#pytorch) page.\n4. Finally, adhere to the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) guide for Linux. Once all components are installed, you can run ComfyUI as described earlier.\n\n#### Cambricon MLUs\n\nFor models compatible with Cambricon Extension for PyTorch (torch_mlu). Here''s a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:\n\n1. Install the Cambricon CNToolkit by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://www.cambricon.com/docs/sdk_1.15.0/cntoolkit_3.7.2/cntoolkit_install_3.7.2/index.html)\n2. Next, install the PyTorch(torch_mlu) following the instructions on the [Installation](https://www.cambricon.com/docs/sdk_1.15.0/cambricon_pytorch_1.17.0/user_guide_1.9/index.html)\n3. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`\n\n#### Iluvatar Corex\n\nFor models compatible with Iluvatar Extension for PyTorch. Here''s a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:\n\n1. Install the Iluvatar Corex Toolkit by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://support.iluvatar.com/#/DocumentCentre?id=1&nameCenter=2&productId=520117912052801536)\n2. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`\n\n\n## [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager/tree/manager-v4)\n\n**ComfyUI-Manager** is an extension that allows you to easily install, update, and manage custom nodes for ComfyUI.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Install the manager dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r manager_requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n2. Enable the manager with the `--enable-manager` flag when running ComfyUI:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py --enable-manager\n   ```\n\n### Command Line Options\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--enable-manager` | Enable ComfyUI-Manager |\n| `--enable-manager-legacy-ui` | Use the legacy manager UI instead of the new UI (requires `--enable-manager`) |\n| `--disable-manager-ui` | Disable the manager UI and endpoints while keeping background features like security checks and scheduled installation completion (requires `--enable-manager`) |\n\n\n# Running\n\n```python main.py```\n\n### For AMD cards not officially supported by ROCm\n\nTry running it with this command if you have issues:\n\nFor 6700, 6600 and maybe other RDNA2 or older: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 python main.py```\n\nFor AMD 7600 and maybe other RDNA3 cards: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 python main.py```\n\n### AMD ROCm Tips\n\nYou can enable experimental memory efficient attention on recent pytorch in ComfyUI on some AMD GPUs using this command, it should already be enabled by default on RDNA3. If this improves speed for you on latest pytorch on your GPU please report it so that I can enable it by default.\n\n```TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 python main.py --use-pytorch-cross-attention```\n\nYou can also try setting this env variable `PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_ENABLED=1` which might speed things up at the cost of a very slow initial run.\n\n# Notes\n\nOnly parts of the graph that have an output with all the correct inputs will be executed.\n\nOnly parts of the graph that change from each execution to the next will be executed, if you submit the same graph twice only the first will be executed. If you change the last part of the graph only the part you changed and the part that depends on it will be executed.\n\nDragging a generated png on the webpage or loading one will give you the full workflow including seeds that were used to create it.\n\nYou can use () to change emphasis of a word or phrase like: (good code:1.2) or (bad code:0.8). The default emphasis for () is 1.1. To use () characters in your actual prompt escape them like \\( or \\).\n\nYou can use {day|night}, for wildcard/dynamic prompts. With this syntax "{wild|card|test}" will be randomly replaced by either "wild", "card" or "test" by the frontend every time you queue the prompt. To use {} characters in your actual prompt escape them like: \\{ or \\}.\n\nDynamic prompts also support C-style comments, like `// comment` or `/* comment */`.\n\nTo use a textual inversion concepts/embeddings in a text prompt put them in the models/embeddings directory and use them in the CLIPTextEncode node like this (you can omit the .pt extension):\n\n```embedding:embedding_filename.pt```\n\n\n## How to show high-quality previews?\n\nUse ```--preview-method auto``` to enable previews.\n\nThe default installation includes a fast latent preview method that''s low-resolution. To enable higher-quality previews with [TAESD](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd), download the [taesd_decoder.pth, taesdxl_decoder.pth, taesd3_decoder.pth and taef1_decoder.pth](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd/) and place them in the `models/vae_approx` folder. Once they''re installed, restart ComfyUI and launch it with `--preview-method taesd` to enable high-quality previews.\n\n## How to use TLS/SSL?\nGenerate a self-signed certificate (not appropriate for shared/production use) and key by running the command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/C=XX/ST=StateName/L=CityName/O=CompanyName/OU=CompanySectionName/CN=CommonNameOrHostname"`\n\nUse `--tls-keyfile key.pem --tls-certfile cert.pem` to enable TLS/SSL, the app will now be accessible with `https://...` instead of `http://...`.\n\n> Note: Windows users can use [alexisrolland/docker-openssl](https://github.com/alexisrolland/docker-openssl) or one of the [3rd party binary distributions](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries) to run the command example above.\n<br/><br/>If you use a container, note that the volume mount `-v` can be a relative path so `... -v ".\:/openssl-certs" ...` would create the key & cert files in the current directory of your command prompt or powershell terminal.\n\n## Support and dev channel\n\n[Discord](https://comfy.org/discord): Try the #help or #feedback channels.\n\n[Matrix space: #comfyui_space:matrix.org](https://app.element.io/#/room/%23comfyui_space%3Amatrix.org) (it''s like discord but open source).\n\nSee also: [https://www.comfy.org/](https://www.comfy.org/)\n\n## Frontend Development\n\nAs of August 15, 2024, we have transitioned to a new frontend, which is now hosted in a separate repository: [ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend). This repository now hosts the compiled JS (from TS/Vue) under the `web/` directory.\n\n### Reporting Issues and Requesting Features\n\nFor any bugs, issues, or feature requests related to the frontend, please use the [ComfyUI Frontend repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend). This will help us manage and address frontend-specific concerns more efficiently.\n\n### Using the Latest Frontend\n\nThe new frontend is now the default for ComfyUI. However, please note:\n\n1. The frontend in the main ComfyUI repository is updated fortnightly.\n2. Daily releases are available in the separate frontend repository.\n\nTo use the most up-to-date frontend version:\n\n1. For the latest daily release, launch ComfyUI with this command line argument:\n\n   ```\n   --front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@latest\n   ```\n\n2. For a specific version, replace `latest` with the desired version number:\n\n   ```\n   --front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@1.2.2\n   ```\n\nThis approach allows you to easily switch between the stable fortnightly release and the cutting-edge daily updates, or even specific versions for testing purposes.\n\n### Accessing the Legacy Frontend\n\nIf you need to use the legacy frontend for any reason, you can access it using the following command line argument:\n\n```\n--front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend@latest\n```\n\nThis will use a snapshot of the legacy frontend preserved in the [ComfyUI Legacy Frontend repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend).\n\n# QA\n\n### Which GPU should I buy for this?\n\n[See this page for some recommendations](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/wiki/Which-GPU-should-I-buy-for-ComfyUI)\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":96115,"forks":10872,"watchers":96115,"open_issues":3276,"topics":["ai","comfy","comfyui","python","pytorch","stable-diffusion"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":76756,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:badges:shields","source_url":"https://github.com/badges/shields"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:user-attachments:assets","source_url":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:desktop","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI_frontend","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI-Manager","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:madebyollin:taesd","source_url":"https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:madebyollin:taesd","source_url":"https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:alexisrolland:docker-openssl","source_url":"https://github.com/alexisrolland/docker-openssl"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI_frontend","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI_frontend","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:Comfy-Org:ComfyUI_legacy_frontend","source_url":"https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:comfyanonymous:ComfyUI","source_url":"https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI"}]', NULL, 'GPL-3.0', 'approved', 80, 'ccecae2cc0f34fc681358c248a32b7a8', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Best for: sharing your applications and hanging out with the community.\n\n## How it works\n\nSupabase is a combination of open source tools. We’re building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. If the tools and communities exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open license, we will use and support that tool. If the tool doesn''t exist, we build and open source it ourselves. Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. Our aim is to give developers a Firebase-like developer experience using open source tools.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nSupabase is a [hosted platform](https://supabase.com/dashboard). You can sign up and start using Supabase without installing anything.\nYou can also [self-host](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/overview) and [develop locally](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development).\n\n![Architecture](apps/docs/public/img/supabase-architecture.svg)\n\n- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.\n- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) is an Elixir server that allows you to listen to PostgreSQL inserts, updates, and deletes using websockets. Realtime polls Postgres'' built-in replication functionality for database changes, converts changes to JSON, then broadcasts the JSON over websockets to authorized clients.\n- [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/) is a web server that turns your PostgreSQL database directly into a RESTful API.\n- [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue) is a JWT-based authentication API that simplifies user sign-ups, logins, and session management in your applications.\n- [Storage](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api) a RESTful API for managing files in S3, with Postgres handling permissions.\n- [pg_graphql](http://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql/) a PostgreSQL extension that exposes a GraphQL API.\n- [postgres-meta](https://github.com/supabase/postgres-meta) is a RESTful API for managing your Postgres, allowing you to fetch tables, add roles, and run queries, etc.\n- [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong) is a cloud-native API gateway.\n\n#### Client libraries\n\nOur approach for client libraries is modular. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing tools.\n\n<table style="table-layout:fixed; white-space: nowrap;">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Language</th>\n    <th>Client</th>\n    <th colspan="5">Feature-Clients

Consider downloading the quickstart version.**\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see the process</summary>\n\n### Installation\n\nThis is more likely to work on your computer but will be slower as it utilizes the CPU.\n\n**1. Set up Your Platform**\n\n-   Python (3.11 recommended)\n-   pip\n-   git\n-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) - ```iex (irm ffmpeg.tc.ht)```\n-   [Visual Studio 2022 Runtimes (Windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)\n\n**2. Clone the Repository**\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git\ncd Deep-Live-Cam\n```\n\n**3. Download the Models**\n\n1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)\n2. [inswapper\_128\_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx)\n\nPlace these files in the "**models**" folder.\n\n**4. Install Dependencies**\n\nWe highly recommend using a `venv` to avoid issues.\n\n\nFor Windows:\n```bash\npython -m venv venv\nvenv\Scripts\activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nFor Linux:\n```bash\n# Ensure you use the installed Python 3.10\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**For macOS:**\n\nApple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) requires specific setup:\n\n```bash\n# Install Python 3.11 (specific version is important)\nbrew install python@3.11\n\n# Install tkinter package (required for the GUI)\nbrew install python-tk@3.10\n\n# Create and activate virtual environment with Python 3.11\npython3.11 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n** In case something goes wrong and you need to reinstall the virtual environment **\n\n```bash\n# Deactivate the virtual environment\nrm -rf venv\n\n# Reinstall the virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# install the dependencies again\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# gfpgan and basicsrs issue fix\npip install git+https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR.git@master\npip uninstall gfpgan -y\npip install git+https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN.git@master\n```\n\n**Run:** If you don''t have a GPU, you can run Deep-Live-Cam using `python run.py`. Note that initial execution will download models (~300MB).\n\n### GPU Acceleration\n\n**CUDA Execution Provider (Nvidia)**\n\n1. Install [CUDA Toolkit 12.8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-8-0-download-archive)\n2.

Developers use us to reliably convert URLs into LLM-ready markdown or structured data with a single API call.",\n    "supports_sso": false,\n    "is_open_source": true,\n    "is_in_yc": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### LLM Extraction (Beta)\n\nUsed to extract structured data from scraped pages.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \\n  -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n  -H ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'' \\n  -d ''{\n    "url": "https://www.mendable.ai/",\n    "formats": [\n      {\n        "type": "json",\n        "schema": {\n          "type": "object",\n          "properties": {\n            "company_mission": { "type": "string" },\n            "supports_sso": { "type": "boolean" },\n            "is_open_source": { "type": "boolean" },\n            "is_in_yc": { "type": "boolean" }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }''\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  "success": true,\n  "data": {\n    "content": "Raw Content",\n    "metadata": {\n      "title": "Mendable",\n      "description": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",\n      "robots": "follow, index",\n      "ogTitle": "Mendable",\n      "ogDescription": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want.

The llm chooses the structure of the data.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \\n    -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n    -H ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'' \\n    -d ''{\n      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",\n      "formats": [\n        {\n          "type": "json",\n          "prompt": "Extract the company mission from the page."\n        }\n      ]\n    }''\n```\n\n### Interacting with the page with Actions (Cloud-only)\n\nFirecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.\n\nHere is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \\n    -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n    -H ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'' \\n    -d ''{\n        "url": "google.com",\n        "formats": ["markdown"],\n        "actions": [\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},\n            {"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title=\"Search\"]"},\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},\n            {"type": "write", "text": "firecrawl"},\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},\n            {"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},\n            {"type": "click", "selector": "h3"},\n            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},\n            {"type": "screenshot"}\n        ]\n    }''\n```\n\n### Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)\n\nYou can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/batch/scrape \\n    -H ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n    -H ''Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'' \\n    -d ''{\n      "urls": ["https://docs.firecrawl.dev", "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview"],\n      "formats" : ["markdown", "html"]\n    }''\n```\n\n\n\n## Using Python SDK\n\n### Installing Python SDK\n\n```bash\npip install firecrawl-py\n```\n\n### Crawl a website\n\n```python\nfrom firecrawl import Firecrawl\n\nfirecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")\n\n# Scrape a website (returns a Document)\ndoc = firecrawl.scrape(\n    "https://firecrawl.dev",\n    formats=["markdown", "html"],\n)\nprint(doc.markdown)\n\n# Crawl a website\nresponse = firecrawl.crawl(\n    "https://firecrawl.dev",\n    limit=100,\n    scrape_options={"formats": ["markdown", "html"]},\n    poll_interval=30,\n)\nprint(response)\n```\n\n### Extracting structured data from a URL\n\nWith LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Article(BaseModel):\n    title: str\n    points: int\n    by: str\n    commentsURL: str\n\nclass TopArticles(BaseModel):\n    top: List[Article] = Field(..., description="Top 5 stories")\n\n# Use JSON format with a Pydantic schema\ndoc = firecrawl.scrape(\n    "https://news.ycombinator.com",\n    formats=[{"type": "json", "schema": TopArticles}],\n)\nprint(doc.json)\n```\n\n## Using the Node SDK\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @mendable/firecrawl-js\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)\n2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `Firecrawl` class.\n\n```js\nimport Firecrawl from ''@mendable/firecrawl-js'';\n\nconst firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: ''fc-YOUR_API_KEY'' });\n\n// Scrape a website\nconst doc = await firecrawl.scrape(''https://firecrawl.dev'', {\n  formats: [''markdown'', ''html''],\n});\nconsole.log(doc);\n\n// Crawl a website\nconst response = await firecrawl.crawl(''https://firecrawl.dev'', {\n  limit: 100,\n  scrapeOptions: { formats: [''markdown'', ''html''] },\n});\nconsole.log(response);\n```\n\n\n### Extracting structured data from a URL\n\nWith LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how to use it:\n\n```js\nimport Firecrawl from ''@mendable/firecrawl-js'';\nimport { z } from ''zod'';\n\nconst firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: ''fc-YOUR_API_KEY'' });\n\n// Define schema to extract contents into\nconst schema = z.object({\n  top: z\n    .array(\n      z.object({\n        title: z.string(),\n        points: z.number(),\n        by: z.string(),\n        commentsURL: z.string(),\n      })\n    )\n    .length(5)\n    .describe(''Top 5 stories on Hacker News''),\n});\n\n// Use the v2 extract API with direct Zod schema support\nconst extractRes = await firecrawl.extract({\n  urls: [''https://news.ycombinator.com''],\n  schema,\n  prompt: ''Extract the top 5 stories'',\n});\n\nconsole.log(extractRes);\n```\n\n## Open Source vs Cloud Offering\n\nFirecrawl is open source available under the AGPL-3.0 license. \n\nTo deliver the best possible product, we offer a hosted version of Firecrawl alongside our open-source offering.

For example, `qwen3` and `qwen3_nothink`.\n>\n> Remember to use the **SAME** template in training and inference.\n>\n> \*: You should install the `transformers` from main branch and use `DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1` to skip version check.\n>\n> \*\*: You need to install a specific version of `transformers` to use the corresponding model.\n\nPlease refer to

The last version to support Python 3.8 - 3.9 was [0.2.6](https://pypi.org/project/gpt-engineer/0.2.6/).\n\n### Setup API key\n\nChoose **one** of:\n- Export env variable (you can add this to .bashrc so that you don''t have to do it each time you start the terminal)\n    - `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`\n- .env file:\n    - Create a copy of `.env.template` named `.env`\n    - Add your OPENAI_API_KEY in .env\n- Custom model:\n    - See [docs](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html), supports local model, azure, etc.\n\nCheck the [Windows README](./WINDOWS_README.md) for Windows usage.\n\n**Other ways to run:**\n- Use Docker ([instructions](docker/README.md))\n- Do everything in your browser:\n[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/codespaces)\n\n### Create new code (default usage)\n- Create an empty folder for your project anywhere on your computer\n- Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions\n- Run `gpte <project_dir>` with a relative path to your folder\n  - For example: `gpte projects/my-new-project` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your new folder in `projects/`\n\n### Improve existing code\n- Locate a folder with code which you want to improve anywhere on your computer\n- Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions for how you want to improve the code\n- Run `gpte <project_dir> -i` with a relative path to your folder\n  - For example: `gpte projects/my-old-project -i` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your folder in `projects/`\n\n### Benchmark custom agents\n- gpt-engineer installs the binary ''bench'', which gives you a simple interface for benchmarking your own agent implementations against popular public datasets.\n- The easiest way to get started with benchmarking is by checking out the [template](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpte-bench-template) repo, which contains detailed instructions and an agent template.\n- Currently supported benchmark:\n  - [APPS](https://github.com/hendrycks/apps)\n  - [MBPP](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp)\n\nThe community has started work with different benchmarking initiatives, as described in [this Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/206805143fbb4302b5455a5329eaab17?sid=f689608f-8e49-44f7-b55f-4c81e9dc93e6) video.\n\n### Research\nSome of our community members have worked on different research briefs that could be taken further. See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmOj2DvdPc6syIAm8iISZFpfik26BYw7ZziD5c-9G0E/edit?usp=sharing) if you are interested.\n\n## Terms\nBy running gpt-engineer, you agree to our [terms](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/TERMS_OF_USE.md).\n\n\n## Relation to gptengineer.app (GPT Engineer)\n[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app/) is a commercial project for the automatic generation of web apps.\nIt features a UI for non-technical users connected to a git-controlled codebase.\nThe gptengineer.app team is actively supporting the open source community.\n\n\n## Features\n\n### Pre Prompts\nYou can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by overriding the `preprompts` folder with your own version of the `preprompts`. You can do so via the `--use-custom-preprompts` argument.\n\nEditing the `preprompts` is how you make the agent remember things between projects.\n\n### Vision\n\nBy default, gpt-engineer expects text input via a `prompt` file. It can also accept image inputs for vision-capable models. This can be useful for adding UX or architecture diagrams as additional context for GPT Engineer. You can do this by specifying an image directory with the `—-image_directory` flag and setting a vision-capable model in the second CLI argument.\n\nE.g. `gpte projects/example-vision gpt-4-vision-preview --prompt_file prompt/text --image_directory prompt/images -i`\n\n### Open source, local and alternative models\n\nBy default, gpt-engineer supports OpenAI Models via the OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI API, as well as Anthropic models.\n\nWith a little extra setup, you can also run with open source models like WizardCoder. See the [documentation](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html) for example instructions.\n\n## Mission\n\nThe gpt-engineer community mission is to **maintain tools that coding agent builders can use and facilitate collaboration in the open source community**.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this, we are interested in having you.\n\nIf you want to see our broader ambitions, check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/ROADMAP.md), and join\n[discord](https://discord.gg/8tcDQ89Ej2)\nto learn how you can [contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to it.\n\ngpt-engineer is [governed](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) by a board of long-term contributors. If you contribute routinely and have an interest in shaping the future of gpt-engineer, you will be considered for the board.\n\n## Significant contributors\n<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;"> <li style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="https://github.com/ATheorell"> <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143704446?s=64&v=4" alt="@ATheorell" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius: 50%;"> @ATheorell </a> </li> <li style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="https://github.com/similato87"> <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71301573?s=64&v=4" alt="@similato87" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius: 50%;"> @similato87 </a> </li> <li style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="https://github.com/TheoMcCabe"> <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9841960?s=64&v=4" alt="@TheoMcCabe" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius: 50%;"> @TheoMcCabe </a> </li> <li style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="https://github.com/captivus"> <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366332?s=64&v=4" alt="@captivus" width="32" height="32" style="border-radius: 50%;"> @captivus </a> </li> </ul>\n\n\n## Example\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/assets/4467025/40d0a9a8-82d0-4432-9376-136df0d57c99\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":55096,"forks":7347,"watchers":55096,"open_issues":66,"topics":["ai","autonomous-agent","code-generation","codebase-generation","codegen","coding-assistant","gpt-4","gpt-engineer","openai","python"],"default_branch":"main","size_kb":20474,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer.git`","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer.git`"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:codespaces:badge.svg","source_url":"https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpte-bench-template","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpte-bench-template"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:hendrycks:apps","source_url":"https://github.com/hendrycks/apps"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:google-research","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/google-research"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:gpt-engineer-org:gpt-engineer","source_url":"https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 65, '0b7d284a74123b67f4b8c0b4f75df4b6', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: **specifications become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.\n\n## ⚡ Get Started\n\n### 1. Install Specify CLI\n\nChoose your preferred installation method:\n\n#### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)\n\nInstall once and use everywhere:\n\n```bash\nuv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git\n```\n\nThen use the tool directly:\n\n```bash\n# Create new project\nspecify init <PROJECT_NAME>\n\n# Or initialize in existing project\nspecify init . --ai claude\n# or\nspecify init --here --ai claude\n\n# Check installed tools\nspecify check\n```\n\nTo upgrade Specify, see the [Upgrade Guide](./docs/upgrade.md) for detailed instructions. Quick upgrade:\n\n```bash\nuv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git\n```\n\n#### Option 2: One-time Usage\n\nRun directly without installing:\n\n```bash\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>\n```\n\n**Benefits of persistent installation:**\n\n- Tool stays installed and available in PATH\n- No need to create shell aliases\n- Better tool management with `uv tool list`, `uv tool upgrade`, `uv tool uninstall`\n- Cleaner shell configuration\n\n### 2. Establish project principles\n\nLaunch your AI assistant in the project directory. The `/speckit.*` commands are available in the assistant.\n\nUse the **`/speckit.constitution`** command to create your project''s governing principles and development guidelines that will guide all subsequent development.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements\n```\n\n### 3. Create the spec\n\nUse the **`/speckit.specify`** command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the tech stack.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.\n```\n\n### 4. Create a technical implementation plan\n\nUse the **`/speckit.plan`** command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.\n```\n\n### 5. Break down into tasks\n\nUse **`/speckit.tasks`** to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.tasks\n```\n\n### 6. Execute implementation\n\nUse **`/speckit.implement`** to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan.\n\n```bash\n/speckit.implement\n```\n\nFor detailed step-by-step instructions, see our [comprehensive guide](./spec-driven.md).\n\n## 📽️ Video Overview\n\nWant to see Spec Kit in action?

Run:\n\n```bash\nspecify init <project_name>\n```\n\nOr initialize in the current directory:\n\n```bash\nspecify init .\n# or use the --here flag\nspecify init --here\n# Skip confirmation when the directory already has files\nspecify init . --force\n# or\nspecify init --here --force\n```\n\n![Specify CLI bootstrapping a new project in the terminal](./media/specify_cli.gif)\n\nYou will be prompted to select the AI agent you are using. You can also proactively specify it directly in the terminal:\n\n```bash\nspecify init <project_name> --ai claude\nspecify init <project_name> --ai gemini\nspecify init <project_name> --ai copilot\n\n# Or in current directory:\nspecify init . --ai claude\nspecify init . --ai codex\n\n# or use --here flag\nspecify init --here --ai claude\nspecify init --here --ai codex\n\n# Force merge into a non-empty current directory\nspecify init . --force --ai claude\n\n# or\nspecify init --here --force --ai claude\n```\n\nThe CLI will check if you have Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, Qwen CLI, opencode, Codex CLI, Qoder CLI, or Amazon Q Developer CLI installed. If you do not, or you prefer to get the templates without checking for the right tools, use `--ignore-agent-tools` with your command:\n\n```bash\nspecify init <project_name> --ai claude --ignore-agent-tools\n```\n\n### **STEP 1:** Establish project principles\n\nGo to the project folder and run your AI agent. In our example, we''re using `claude`.\n\n![Bootstrapping Claude Code environment](./media/bootstrap-claude-code.gif)\n\nYou will know that things are configured correctly if you see the `/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, and `/speckit.implement` commands available.\n\nThe first step should be establishing your project''s governing principles using the `/speckit.constitution` command. This helps ensure consistent decision-making throughout all subsequent development phases:\n\n```text\n/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements. Include governance for how these principles should guide technical decisions and implementation choices.\n```\n\nThis step creates or updates the `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file with your project''s foundational guidelines that the AI agent will reference during specification, planning, and implementation phases.\n\n### **STEP 2:** Create project specifications\n\nWith your project principles established, you can now create the functional specifications. Use the `/speckit.specify` command and then provide the concrete requirements for the project you want to develop.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Be as explicit as possible about *what* you are trying to build and *why*. **Do not focus on the tech stack at this point**.\n\nAn example prompt:\n\n```text\nDevelop Taskify, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members,\nassign tasks, comment and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature,\nlet''s call it "Create Taskify," let''s have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined.\nI want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let''s create three\ndifferent sample projects. Let''s have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as "To Do,"\n"In Progress," "In Review," and "Done." There will be no login for this application as this is just the very\nfirst testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card,\nyou should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board.\nYou should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task\ncard, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it''s going to give you a list of the five users to pick\nfrom. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of\nprojects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You''re going to see the columns.\nYou''ll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are\nassigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly\nsee yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can''t edit comments that other people made. You can\ndelete any comments that you made, but you can''t delete comments anybody else made.\n```\n\nAfter this prompt is entered, you should see Claude Code kick off the planning and spec drafting process. Claude Code will also trigger some of the built-in scripts to set up the repository.\n\nOnce this step is completed, you should have a new branch created (e.g., `001-create-taskify`), as well as a new specification in the `specs/001-create-taskify` directory.\n\nThe produced specification should contain a set of user stories and functional requirements, as defined in the template.\n\nAt this stage, your project folder contents should resemble the following:\n\n```text\n└── .specify\n    ├── memory\n    │  └── constitution.md\n    ├── scripts\n    │  ├── check-prerequisites.sh\n    │  ├── common.sh\n    │  ├── create-new-feature.sh\n    │  ├── setup-plan.sh\n    │  └── update-claude-md.sh\n    ├── specs\n    │  └── 001-create-taskify\n    │      └── spec.md\n    └── templates\n        ├── plan-template.md\n        ├── spec-template.md\n        └── tasks-template.md\n```\n\n### **STEP 3:** Functional specification clarification (required before planning)\n\nWith the baseline specification created, you can go ahead and clarify any of the requirements that were not captured properly within the first shot attempt.\n\nYou should run the structured clarification workflow **before** creating a technical plan to reduce rework downstream.\n\nPreferred order:\n\n1. Use `/speckit.clarify` (structured) – sequential, coverage-based questioning that records answers in a Clarifications section.\n2. Optionally follow up with ad-hoc free-form refinement if something still feels vague.\n\nIf you intentionally want to skip clarification (e.g., spike or exploratory prototype), explicitly state that so the agent doesn''t block on missing clarifications.\n\nExample free-form refinement prompt (after `/speckit.clarify` if still needed):\n\n```text\nFor each sample project or project that you create there should be a variable number of tasks between 5 and 15\ntasks for each one randomly distributed into different states of completion. Make sure that there''s at least\none task in each stage of completion.\n```\n\nYou should also ask Claude Code to validate the **Review & Acceptance Checklist**, checking off the things that are validated/pass the requirements, and leave the ones that are not unchecked. The following prompt can be used:\n\n```text\nRead the review and acceptance checklist, and check off each item in the checklist if the feature spec meets the criteria. Leave it empty if it does not.\n```\n\nIt''s important to use the interaction with Claude Code as an opportunity to clarify and ask questions around the specification - **do not treat its first attempt as final**.\n\n### **STEP 4:** Generate a plan\n\nYou can now be specific about the tech stack and other technical requirements. You can use the `/speckit.plan` command that is built into the project template with a prompt like this:\n\n```text\nWe are going to generate this using .NET Aspire, using Postgres as the database. The frontend should use\nBlazor server with drag-and-drop task boards, real-time updates. There should be a REST API created with a projects API,\ntasks API, and a notifications API.\n```\n\nThe output of this step will include a number of implementation detail documents, with your directory tree resembling this:\n\n```text\n.\n├── CLAUDE.md\n├── memory\n│  └── constitution.md\n├── scripts\n│  ├── check-prerequisites.sh\n│  ├── common.sh\n│  ├── create-new-feature.sh\n│  ├── setup-plan.sh\n│  └── update-claude-md.sh\n├── specs\n│  └── 001-create-taskify\n│      ├── contracts\n│      │  ├── api-spec.json\n│      │  └── signalr-spec.md\n│      ├── data-model.md\n│      ├── plan.md\n│      ├── quickstart.md\n│      ├── research.md\n│      └── spec.md\n└── templates\n    ├── CLAUDE-template.md\n    ├── plan-template.md\n    ├── spec-template.md\n    └── tasks-template.md\n```\n\nCheck the `research.md` document to ensure that the right tech stack is used, based on your instructions. You can ask Claude Code to refine it if any of the components stand out, or even have it check the locally-installed version of the platform/framework you want to use (e.g., .NET).\n\nAdditionally, you might want to ask Claude Code to research details about the chosen tech stack if it''s something that is rapidly changing (e.g., .NET Aspire, JS frameworks), with a prompt like this:\n\n```text\nI want you to go through the implementation plan and implementation details, looking for areas that could\nbenefit from additional research as .NET Aspire is a rapidly changing library. For those areas that you identify that\nrequire further research, I want you to update the research document with additional details about the specific\nversions that we are going to be using in this Taskify application and spawn parallel research tasks to clarify\nany details using research from the web.\n```\n\nDuring this process, you might find that Claude Code gets stuck researching the wrong thing - you can help nudge it in the right direction with a prompt like this:\n\n```text\nI think we need to break this down into a series of steps. First, identify a list of tasks\nthat you would need to do during implementation that you''re not sure of or would benefit\nfrom further research. Write down a list of those tasks. And then for each one of these tasks,\nI want you to spin up a separate research task so that the net results is we are researching\nall of those very specific tasks in parallel. What I saw you doing was it looks like you were\nresearching .NET Aspire in general and I don''t think that''s gonna do much for us in this case.\nThat''s way too untargeted research. The research needs to help you solve a specific targeted question.\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Claude Code might be over-eager and add components that you did not ask for. Ask it to clarify the rationale and the source of the change.\n\n### **STEP 5:** Have Claude Code validate the plan\n\nWith the plan in place, you should have Claude Code run through it to make sure that there are no missing pieces. You can use a prompt like this:\n\n```text\nNow I want you to go and audit the implementation plan and the implementation detail files.\nRead through it with an eye on determining whether or not there is a sequence of tasks that you need\nto be doing that are obvious from reading this. Because I don''t know if there''s enough here. For example,\nwhen I look at the core implementation, it would be useful to reference the appropriate places in the implementation\ndetails where it can find the information as it walks through each step in the core implementation or in the refinement.\n```\n\nThis helps refine the implementation plan and helps you avoid potential blind spots that Claude Code missed in its planning cycle. Once the initial refinement pass is complete, ask Claude Code to go through the checklist once more before you can get to the implementation.\n\nYou can also ask Claude Code (if you have the [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli) installed) to go ahead and create a pull request from your current branch to `main` with a detailed description, to make sure that the effort is properly tracked.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Before you have the agent implement it, it''s also worth prompting Claude Code to cross-check the details to see if there are any over-engineered pieces (remember - it can be over-eager). If over-engineered components or decisions exist, you can ask Claude Code to resolve them. Ensure that Claude Code follows the [constitution](base/memory/constitution.md) as the foundational piece that it must adhere to when establishing the plan.\n\n### **STEP 6:** Generate task breakdown with /speckit.tasks\n\nWith the implementation plan validated, you can now break down the plan into specific, actionable tasks that can be executed in the correct order. Use the `/speckit.tasks` command to automatically generate a detailed task breakdown from your implementation plan:\n\n```text\n/speckit.tasks\n```\n\nThis step creates a `tasks.md` file in your feature specification directory that contains:\n\n- **Task breakdown organized by user story** - Each user story becomes a separate implementation phase with its own set of tasks\n- **Dependency management** - Tasks are ordered to respect dependencies between components (e.g., models before services, services before endpoints)\n- **Parallel execution markers** - Tasks that can run in parallel are marked with `[P]` to optimize development workflow\n- **File path specifications** - Each task includes the exact file paths where implementation should occur\n- **Test-driven development structure** - If tests are requested, test tasks are included and ordered to be written before implementation\n- **Checkpoint validation** - Each user story phase includes checkpoints to validate independent functionality\n\nThe generated tasks.md provides a clear roadmap for the `/speckit.implement` command, ensuring systematic implementation that maintains code quality and allows for incremental delivery of user stories.\n\n### **STEP 7:** Implementation\n\nOnce ready, use the `/speckit.implement` command to execute your implementation plan:\n\n```text\n/speckit.implement\n```\n\nThe `/speckit.implement` command will:\n\n- Validate that all prerequisites are in place (constitution, spec, plan, and tasks)\n- Parse the task breakdown from `tasks.md`\n- Execute tasks in the correct order, respecting dependencies and parallel execution markers\n- Follow the TDD approach defined in your task plan\n- Provide progress updates and handle errors appropriately\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The AI agent will execute local CLI commands (such as `dotnet`, `npm`, etc.) - make sure you have the required tools installed on your machine.\n\nOnce the implementation is complete, test the application and resolve any runtime errors that may not be visible in CLI logs (e.g., browser console errors). You can copy and paste such errors back to your AI agent for resolution.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Troubleshooting\n\n### Git Credential Manager on Linux\n\nIf you''re having issues with Git authentication on Linux, you can install Git Credential Manager:\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\necho "Downloading Git Credential Manager v2.6.1..."\nwget https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/releases/download/v2.6.1/gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb\necho "Installing Git Credential Manager..."\nsudo dpkg -i gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb\necho "Configuring Git to use GCM..."\ngit config --global credential.helper manager\necho "Cleaning up..."\nrm gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb\n```\n\n## 👥 Maintainers\n\n- Den Delimarsky ([@localden](https://github.com/localden))\n- John Lam ([@jflam](https://github.com/jflam))\n\n## 💬 Support\n\nFor support, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/new).
