Update\n**2024.10.20**: We have uploaded the correct `tokenizer_config.json`. The previous file was missing the `pad_token`, which caused poor visual generation results.\n\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nJanus is a novel autoregressive framework that unifies multimodal understanding and generation. \nIt addresses the limitations of previous approaches by decoupling visual encoding into separate pathways, while still utilizing a single, unified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder’s roles in understanding and generation, but also enhances the framework’s flexibility. \nJanus surpasses previous unified model and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. \nThe simplicity, high flexibility, and effectiveness of Janus make it a strong candidate for next-generation unified multimodal models.\n\n[Janus: Decoupling Visual Encoding for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13848)\n\n[**Github Repository**](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus)\n\n<div align="center">\n<img alt="image" src="teaser.png" style="width:90%;">\n</div>\n\n\n### 2. Model Summary\n\nJanus is a unified understanding and generation MLLM, which decouples visual encoding for multimodal understanding and generation. \nJanus is constructed based on the DeepSeek-LLM-1.3b-base which is trained on an approximate corpus of 500B text tokens.\nFor multimodal understanding, it uses the [SigLIP-L](https://huggingface.co/timm/ViT-L-16-SigLIP-384) as the vision encoder, which supports 384 x 384 image input. For image generation, Janus uses the tokenizer from [here](https://github.com/FoundationVision/LlamaGen) with a downsample rate of 16.\n\n<div align="center">\n<img alt="image" src="arch.jpg" style="width:90%;">\n</div>\n\n## 3.

Introduction\n\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\n\n**NOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the [Usage Recommendation](#usage-recommendations) section.**\n\n<p align="center">\n  <img width="80%" src="figures/benchmark.jpg">\n</p>\n\n## 2. Model Summary\n\n---\n\n**Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model**\n\n-  We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\n\n-   We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model''s reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\n    We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models. \n\n---\n\n**Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too**\n\n-  We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \n- Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\n## 3.

How to Run Locally\n\n### DeepSeek-R1 Models\n\nPlease visit [DeepSeek-V3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\n\n**NOTE: Hugging Face''s Transformers has not been directly supported yet.**\n\n### DeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\n\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm):\n\n```shell\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\n```\n\nYou can also easily start a service using [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)\n\n```bash\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n```\n\n### Usage Recommendations\n\n**We recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:**\n\n1. Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\n2. **Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.**\n3. For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."\n4. When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\n\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting "\<think\>\n\n\</think\>") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model''s performance.\n**To ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with "\<think\>\n" at the beginning of every output.**\n\n## 7.

Check them out!\n\n## Quick start\n<hr />\n\n## Installation\n```bash\npip install InstructorEmbedding\n```\n\n## Compute your customized embeddings\nThen you can use the model like this to calculate domain-specific and task-aware embeddings:\n```python\nfrom InstructorEmbedding import INSTRUCTOR\nmodel = INSTRUCTOR(''hkunlp/instructor-xl'')\nsentence = "3D ActionSLAM: wearable person tracking in multi-floor environments"\ninstruction = "Represent the Science title:"\nembeddings = model.encode([[instruction,sentence]])\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n## Use cases\n<hr />\n\n## Calculate embeddings for your customized texts\nIf you want to calculate customized embeddings for specific sentences, you may follow the unified template to write instructions: \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Represent the `domain` `text_type` for `task_objective`:\n* `domain` is optional, and it specifies the domain of the text, e.g., science, finance, medicine, etc.\n* `text_type` is required, and it specifies the encoding unit, e.g., sentence, document, paragraph, etc.\n* `task_objective` is optional, and it specifies the objective of embedding, e.g., retrieve a document, classify the sentence, etc.\n\n## Calculate Sentence similarities\nYou can further use the model to compute similarities between two groups of sentences, with **customized embeddings**.\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nsentences_a = [[''Represent the Science sentence: '',''Parton energy loss in QCD matter''], \n               [''Represent the Financial statement: '',''The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate.'']]\nsentences_b = [[''Represent the Science sentence: '',''The Chiral Phase Transition in Dissipative Dynamics''],\n               [''Represent the Financial statement: '',''The funds rose less than 0.5 per cent on Friday'']]\nembeddings_a = model.encode(sentences_a)\nembeddings_b = model.encode(sentences_b)\nsimilarities = cosine_similarity(embeddings_a,embeddings_b)\nprint(similarities)\n```\n\n## Information Retrieval\nYou can also use **customized embeddings** for information retrieval.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nquery  = [[''Represent the Wikipedia question for retrieving supporting documents: '',''where is the food stored in a yam plant'']]\ncorpus = [[''Represent the Wikipedia document for retrieval: '',''Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism, but most feel[who?] that the term "mixed economies" more precisely describes most contemporary economies, due to their containing both private-owned and state-owned enterprises. In capitalism, prices determine the demand-supply scale. For example, higher demand for certain goods and services lead to higher prices and lower demand for certain goods lead to lower prices.''],\n          [''Represent the Wikipedia document for retrieval: '',"The disparate impact theory is especially controversial under the Fair Housing Act because the Act regulates many activities relating to housing, insurance, and mortgage loansâ€”and some scholars have argued that the theory''s use under the Fair Housing Act, combined with extensions of the Community Reinvestment Act, contributed to rise of sub-prime lending and the crash of the U.S. housing market and ensuing global economic recession"],\n          [''Represent the Wikipedia document for retrieval: '',''Disparate impact in United States labor law refers to practices in employment, housing, and other areas that adversely affect one group of people of a protected characteristic more than another, even though rules applied by employers or landlords are formally neutral. Although the protected classes vary by statute, most federal civil rights laws protect based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex as protected traits, and some laws include disability status and other traits as well.'']]\nquery_embeddings = model.encode(query)\ncorpus_embeddings = model.encode(corpus)\nsimilarities = cosine_similarity(query_embeddings,corpus_embeddings)\nretrieved_doc_id = np.argmax(similarities)\nprint(retrieved_doc_id)\n```\n\n## Clustering\nUse **customized embeddings** for clustering texts in groups.\n```python\nimport sklearn.cluster\nsentences = [[''Represent the Medicine sentence for clustering: '',''Dynamical Scalar Degree of Freedom in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity''],\n             [''Represent the Medicine sentence for clustering: '',''Comparison of Atmospheric Neutrino Flux Calculations at Low Energies''],\n             [''Represent the Medicine sentence for clustering: '',''Fermion Bags in the Massive Gross-Neveu Model''],\n             [''Represent the Medicine sentence for clustering: '',"QCD corrections to Associated t-tbar-H production at the Tevatron"],\n             [''Represent the Medicine sentence for clustering: '',''A New Analysis of the R Measurements: Resonance Parameters of the Higher,  Vector States of Charmonium'']]\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nclustering_model = sklearn.cluster.MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=2)\nclustering_model.fit(embeddings)\ncluster_assignment = clustering_model.labels_\nprint(cluster_assignment)\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"sentence-similarity","library_name":"sentence-transformers","framework":"sentence-transformers","params":null,"storage_bytes":19868112990,"files_count":14,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["T5EncoderModel"],"model_type":"t5","tokenizer_config":{"eos_token":"</s>","pad_token":"<pad>","unk_token":"<unk>"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:HKUNLP:instructor-embedding","source_url":"https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding"},{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2212.09741","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09741"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 77.6, 'f335b9f3ecd3ab122b4247dcad40c0e1', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

The model achieves 43.1% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME 2024, representing a 15% improvement over the base model (28.8%) and surpassing OpenAI''s O1-Preview performance with just 1.5B parameters.\n\n## Data\nOur training dataset consists of approximately 40,000 unique problem-answer pairs compiled from:\n- AIME problems (1984-2023)\n- AMC problems (prior to 2023)\n- Omni-MATH dataset\n- Still dataset\n\n## Training Recipe\nWe employ Deepseek''s Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a simplified RL algorithm that extends PPO by:\n- Normalizing advantage function over all samples generated from the same prompt.\n- Applying KL divergence regularization on top of PPO''s surrogate loss to prevent significant policy drift.\n\n**Reward Function**: Our reward function is simple but effective:\n- 1 for correct answers passing LaTeX/Sympy checks\n- 0 for incorrect or improperly formatted answers\n- Note: No partial rewards (such as PRMs) or intermediate feedback.\n\n**Iterative Context Lengthening**: A key challenge in scaling RL for reasoning is compute cost. Our approach trains models with progressively longer contexts as the model improves, thus saving monetary costs and end2end training time: \n- Initial 8K Context (0-1040 steps):\n    - 22.9% -> 33% Pass@1 on AIME 2024\n    - Trained on 8 A100-80GB GPUs, BS= (Prompts) * (Samples/Prompt) = 128 * 8 = 1024\n- Extended to 16K (steps 1040-1520):\n    - 33% -> 43% Pass@1 on AIME 2024\n    - Trained on 32 A100-80GB GPUs, BS= (Prompts) * (Samples/Prompt) = 128 * 16 = 2048\n- Further extended to 24K (step 1520+):\n    - 38% -> 43% Pass@1 on AIME 2024\n    - Trained on 32 A100-80GB GPUs, BS= (Prompts) * (Samples/Prompt) = 128 * 16 = 2048\n    - Significant improvements within <200 steps\n\nA more detailed description of the training recipe can be found in our [blog post](https://pretty-radio-b75.notion.site/DeepScaleR-Surpassing-O1-Preview-with-a-1-5B-Model-by-Scaling-RL-19681902c1468005bed8ca303013a4e2).\n\n## Evaluation\nWe report Pass@1 accuracy averaged over 16 samples for each problem.\n| Model | AIME 2024 | MATH 500 | AMC 2023 | Minerva Math | OlympiadBench | Avg. |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|------|\n| Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct | 13.3 | 79.8 | 50.6 | 34.6 | 40.7 | 43.8 |\n| rStar-Math-7B | 26.7 | 78.4 | 47.5 | - | 47.1 | - |\n| Eurus-2-7B-PRIME | 26.7 | 79.2 | 57.8 | 38.6 | 42.1 | 48.9 |\n| Qwen2.5-7B-SimpleRL | 26.7 | 82.4 | 62.5 | <strong>39.7</strong> | 43.3 | 50.9 |\n| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B | 28.8 | 82.8 | 62.9 | 26.5 | 43.3 | 48.9 |\n| Still-1.5B | 32.5 | 84.4 | 66.7 | 29.0 | 45.4 | 51.6 |\n| <strong>DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview</strong> | <strong>43.1</strong> | <strong>87.8</strong> | <strong>73.6</strong> | 30.2 | <strong>50.0</strong> | <strong>57.0</strong> |\n| O1-Preview | 40.0 | 81.4 | - | - | - | - |\n\n## Serving DeepScaleR\nOur model can be served using popular high-performance inference systems:\n- vLLM\n- Hugging Face Text Generation Inference (TGI)\n- SGLang\n- TensorRT-LLM\n\nAll these systems support the OpenAI Chat Completions API format.\n\n## License\nThis project is released under the MIT License, reflecting our commitment to open and accessible AI development.\nWe believe in democratizing AI technology by making our work freely available for anyone to use, modify, and build upon.\nThis permissive license ensures that researchers, developers, and enthusiasts worldwide can leverage and extend our work without restrictions, fostering innovation and collaboration in the AI community.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n- Our training experiments are powered by our heavily modified fork of [Verl](https://github.com/agentica-project/verl), an open-source RLHF library.\n- Our model is trained on top of [`DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B`](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B).\n- Our work is done as part of  [Berkeley Sky Computing Lab](https://skycomputing.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/).\n\n## Citation \n```bibtex\n@misc{deepscaler2025,\n  title={DeepScaleR: Surpassing O1-Preview with a 1.5B Model by Scaling RL},\n  author={Michael Luo and Sijun Tan and Justin Wong and Xiaoxiang Shi and William Y.

It learns an inner \nrepresentation of the English language that can be used to extract features \nuseful for downstream tasks.\n\nIn addition to scientific uses, you may also further fine-tune and adapt \nGPT-NeoX-20B for deployment, as long as your use is in accordance with the \nApache 2.0 license. This model works with the [Transformers \nLibrary](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index). If you decide to use \npre-trained GPT-NeoX-20B as a basis for your fine-tuned model, please note that \nyou need to conduct your own risk and bias assessment. \n\n#### Out-of-scope use\n\nGPT-NeoX-20B is **not** intended for deployment as-is. It is not a product \nand cannot be used for human-facing interactions without supervision.\n\nGPT-NeoX-20B has not been fine-tuned for downstream tasks for which language \nmodels are commonly deployed, such as writing genre prose, or commercial \nchatbots. This means GPT-NeoX-20B will likely **not** respond to a given prompt \nthe way products such as ChatGPT do. This is because, unlike GPT-NeoX-20B, \nChatGPT was fine-tuned using methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human \nFeedback (RLHF) to better “understand” human instructions and dialogue.\n\nThis model is English-language only, and thus cannot be used for translation\nor generating text in other languages.\n\n#### Limitations and biases\n\nThe core functionality of GPT-NeoX-20B is to take a string of text and predict \nthe next token. Remember that the statistically most likely next token need \nnot result in the most “accurate” text. Never rely on GPT-NeoX-20B to produce \nfactually accurate output.\n\nThis model was trained on [the Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/), a dataset \nknown to contain profanity and texts that are lewd or otherwise offensive. \nSee [Section 6 of the Pile paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027) for a \ndiscussion of documented biases with regards to gender, religion, and race. \nGPT-NeoX-20B may produce socially unacceptable or undesirable text, *even if*\n the prompt itself does not include anything explicitly offensive. \n\nWe recommend curating the outputs of this model before presenting it to a human \nreader. Please inform your audience that you are using artificially generated \ntext. \n\n#### How to use\n If you simply want to try out some prompts, check out [this \n playground](https://20b.eleuther.ai/).\n \n GPT-NeoX-20B can be loaded using the `AutoModelForCausalLM` functionality:\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b")\n```\n\n### Training\n\n#### Training dataset\n\nThe Pile is a 825GiB general-purpose dataset in English. It was created by \nEleutherAI specifically for training large language models. It contains texts \nfrom 22 diverse sources, roughly broken down into five categories: academic \nwriting (e.g. arXiv), internet (e.g. CommonCrawl), prose (e.g. Project \nGutenberg), dialogue (e.g. YouTube subtitles), and miscellaneous (e.g. GitHub, \nEnron Emails). See [the Pile paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027) for \na breakdown of all data sources, methodology, and a discussion of ethical \nimplications. Consult [the datasheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07311) for \nmore detailed documentation about the Pile and its component datasets. The \nPile can be downloaded from the [official website](https://pile.eleuther.ai/), \nor from a [community mirror](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/pile/).\n\nThe Pile was **not** deduplicated before being used to train GPT-NeoX-20B.\n\n#### Training procedure\n\nGPT-NeoX-20B was trained with a batch size of approximately 3.15M tokens \n(1538 sequences of 2048 tokens each), for a total of 150,000 steps. Tensor \nparallelism and pipeline parallelism were used to distribute the model across \nGPUs. Additional details about the training procedure are in [Section 3 of \nthe accompanying paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06745).\n\n\n### Evaluations\n\n<figure style="width:55em">\n\n| Model         | OpenAI’s LAMBADA | SciQ          | PIQA          | TriviaQA      | ARC (Challenge) |\n| ------------- | :--------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: |\n| GPT-J-6B      | 0.683 ± 0.006    | 0.910 ± 0.009 | 0.752 ± 0.010 | 0.170 ± 0.004 | 0.340 ± 0.014   |\n| FairSeq 6.7B  | 0.673 ± 0.007    | 0.895 ± 0.010 | 0.762 ± 0.010 | 0.221 ± 0.004 | 0.329 ± 0.014   |\n| GPT-3 Curie   | 0.693 ± 0.006    | 0.918 ± 0.009 | 0.767 ± 0.010 | 0.196 ± 0.004 | 0.334 ± 0.014   |\n| FairSeq 13B   | 0.709 ± 0.006    | 0.910 ± 0.009 | 0.769 ± 0.010 | 0.270 ± 0.004 | 0.345 ± 0.014   |\n| GPT-NeoX-20B  | 0.720 ± 0.006    | 0.928 ± 0.008 | 0.779 ± 0.010 | 0.259 ± 0.004 | 0.380 ± 0.014   |\n| GPT-3 DaVinci | 0.752 ± 0.006    | 0.949 ± 0.007 | 0.791 ± 0.009 | 0.409 ± 0.005 | 0.435 ± 0.014   |\n<figcaption>Zero-shot performance on selected natural language tasks.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis is a heavily abridged version of the evaluation results.

Cropping and resizing happens here.\n- tool_download_face_targets.py - A tool to read metadata.json and populate the target folder.\n- tool_generate_face_poses.py - The original file used to generate the source images.  Included for reproducibility, but not required for training.\n- training/laion-face-processed/prompt.jsonl - Read by laion_face_dataset.  Includes prompts for the images.\n- training/laion-face-processed/metadata.json - Excerpts from LAION for the relevant data.  Also used for downloading the target dataset.\n- training/laion-face-processed/source/xxxxxxxxx.jpg - Images with detections performed.  Generated from the target images.\n- training/laion-face-processed/target/xxxxxxxxx.jpg - Selected images from LAION Face.\n\n## Dataset Construction:\n\nSource images were generated by pulling slice 00000 from LAION Face and passing them through MediaPipe''s face detector with special configuration parameters.  \n\nThe colors and line thicknesses used for MediaPipe are as follows:\n\n```\nf_thick = 2\nf_rad = 1\nright_iris_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 200, 250), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)\nright_eye_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 200, 180), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)\nright_eyebrow_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 220, 180), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)\nleft_iris_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(250, 200, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)\nleft_eye_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(180, 200, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)\nleft_eyebrow_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(180, 220, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)\nmouth_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 180, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)\nhead_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 200, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)\n\niris_landmark_spec = {468: right_iris_draw, 473: left_iris_draw}\n```\n\nWe have implemented a method named `draw_pupils` which modifies some functionality from MediaPipe.  It exists as a stopgap until some pending changes are merged.\n\n\n# Usage:\n\nThe containing ZIP file should be decompressed into the root of the ControlNet directory.  The `train_laion_face.py`, `laion_face_dataset.py`, and other `.py` files should sit adjacent to `tutorial_train.py` and `tutorial_train_sd21.py`.  We are assuming a checkout of the ControlNet repo at 0acb7e5, but there is no direct dependency on the repository.\n\n## Downloading:\n\nFor copyright reasons, we cannot include the original target files.  We have provided a script (tool_download_face_targets.py) which will read from training/laion-face-processed/metadata.json and populate the target folder.  This file has no requirements, but will use tqdm if it is installed.\n\n## Training:\n\nWhen the targets folder is fully populated, training can be run on a machine with at least 24 gigabytes of VRAM.  Our model was trained for 200 hours (four epochs) on an A6000.\n\n```bash\npython tool_add_control.py ./models/v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt ./models/controlnet_sd15_laion_face.ckpt\npython ./train_laion_face_sd15.py\n```\n\n## Inference:\n\nWe have provided `gradio_face2image.py`.  Update the following two lines to point them to your trained model.\n\n```\nmodel = create_model(''./models/cldm_v21.yaml'').cpu()  # If you fine-tune on SD2.1 base, this does not need to change.\nmodel.load_state_dict(load_state_dict(''./models/control_sd21_openpose.pth'', location=''cuda''))\n```\n\nThe model has some limitations: while it is empirically better at tracking gaze and mouth poses than previous attempts, it may still ignore controls.  Adding details to the prompt like, "looking right" can abate bad behavior. \n\n## 🧨 Diffusers\n\nIt is recommended to use the checkpoint with [Stable Diffusion 2.1 - Base](stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base) as the checkpoint has been trained on it.\nExperimentally, the checkpoint can be used with other diffusion models such as dreamboothed stable diffusion.\n\nTo use with Stable Diffusion 1.5, insert `subfolder="diffusion_sd15"` into the from_pretrained arguments.  A v1.5 half-precision variant is provided but untested.\n\n1. Install `diffusers` and related packages:\n```\n$ pip install diffusers transformers accelerate\n```\n\n2. Run code:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline, ControlNetModel, UniPCMultistepScheduler\nfrom diffusers.utils import load_image\n\nimage = load_image(\n    "https://huggingface.co/CrucibleAI/ControlNetMediaPipeFace/resolve/main/samples_laion_face_dataset/family_annotation.png"\n)\n\n# Stable Diffusion 2.1-base:\ncontrolnet = ControlNetModel.from_pretrained("CrucibleAI/ControlNetMediaPipeFace", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16")\npipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained(\n	"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base", controlnet=controlnet, safety_checker=None, torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\n# OR\n# Stable Diffusion 1.5:\ncontrolnet = ControlNetModel.from_pretrained("CrucibleAI/ControlNetMediaPipeFace", subfolder="diffusion_sd15")\npipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", controlnet=controlnet, safety_checker=None)\n\npipe.scheduler = UniPCMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)\n\n# Remove if you do not have xformers installed\n# see https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.13.0/en/optimization/xformers#installing-xformers\n# for installation instructions\npipe.enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()\npipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()\n\nimage = pipe("a happy family at a dentist advertisement", image=image, num_inference_steps=30).images[0]\nimage.save(''./images.png'')\n```\n\n\n# License:\n\n### Source Images: (/training/laion-face-processed/source/)\nThis work is marked with CC0 1.0.

During this period, we focused on building more useful vision-language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2.5-VL.\n\n#### Key Enhancements:\n* **Understand things visually**: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.\n\n* **Being agentic**: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.\n\n* **Understanding long videos and capturing events**: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of cpaturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.\n\n* **Capable of visual localization in different formats**: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.\n\n* **Generating structured outputs**: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.\n\n\n#### Model Architecture Updates:\n\n* **Dynamic Resolution and Frame Rate Training for Video Understanding**:\n\nWe extend dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension by adopting dynamic FPS sampling, enabling the model to comprehend videos at various sampling rates. Accordingly, we update mRoPE in the time dimension with IDs and absolute time alignment, enabling the model to learn temporal sequence and speed, and ultimately acquire the ability to pinpoint specific moments.\n\n<p align="center">\n    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-VL/qwen2.5vl_arc.jpeg" width="80%"/>\n<p>\n\n\n* **Streamlined and Efficient Vision Encoder**\n\nWe enhance both training and inference speeds by strategically implementing window attention into the ViT. The ViT architecture is further optimized with SwiGLU and RMSNorm, aligning it with the structure of the Qwen2.5 LLM.\n\n\nWe have three models with 3, 7 and 72 billion parameters. This repo contains the instruction-tuned 3B Qwen2.5-VL model. For more information, visit our [Blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL).\n\n\n\n## Evaluation\n\n### Image benchmark\n\n| Benchmark | InternVL2.5-4B |Qwen2-VL-7B |Qwen2.5-VL-3B |\n| :--- | :---:  | :---: | :---: |\n| MMMU<sub>val</sub>  | 52.3 | 54.1 | 53.1| \n| MMMU-Pro<sub>val</sub>  | **32.7** | 30.5 | 31.6|\n| AI2D<sub>test</sub> | 81.4 | **83.0** | 81.5 |\n| DocVQA<sub>test</sub>  | 91.6 | 94.5 | **93.9** | \n| InfoVQA<sub>test</sub>  | 72.1 | 76.5 | **77.1** |\n| TextVQA<sub>val</sub>  | 76.8 | **84.3** | 79.3|\n| MMBench-V1.1<sub>test</sub>  | 79.3 | **80.7** | 77.6 | \n| MMStar | 58.3 | **60.7** | 55.9 | \n| MathVista<sub>testmini</sub>  | 60.5 | 58.2 | **62.3** |\n| MathVision<sub>full</sub>  | 20.9 | 16.3  | **21.2** |\n\n\n### Video benchmark\n| Benchmark | InternVL2.5-4B | Qwen2-VL-7B | Qwen2.5-VL-3B |\n| :--- | :---:  | :---: | :---: |\n| MVBench | 71.6 | 67.0 | 67.0 |\n| VideoMME | 63.6/62.3 | 69.0/63.3 | 67.6/61.5 |\n| MLVU | 48.3 | - | 68.2 |\n| LVBench | - | - | 43.3 |\n| MMBench-Video | 1.73 | 1.44 | 1.63 |\n| EgoSchema | - | - | 64.8 |\n| PerceptionTest | - | - | 66.9 |\n| TempCompass | - | - | 64.4 |\n| LongVideoBench | 55.2 | 55.6 | 54.2 |\n| CharadesSTA/mIoU | - | - | 38.8 |\n\n\n### Agent benchmark\n| Benchmarks              | Qwen2.5-VL-3B |\n|-------------------------|---------------|\n| ScreenSpot              |     55.5    |\n| ScreenSpot Pro          |     23.9    |\n| AITZ_EM                 |  	76.9    |\n| Android Control High_EM |    	63.7    |\n| Android Control Low_EM  |  	22.2    |\n| AndroidWorld_SR         | 	90.8  	|\n| MobileMiniWob++_SR      | 	67.9    |\n\n## Requirements\nThe code of Qwen2.5-VL has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to build from source with command:\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers accelerate\n```\nor you might encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen2_5_vl''\n```\n\n\n## Quickstart\n\nBelow, we provide simple examples to show how to use Qwen2.5-VL with 🤖 ModelScope and 🤗 Transformers.\n\nThe code of Qwen2.5-VL has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to build from source with command:\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers accelerate\n```\nor you might encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen2_5_vl''\n```\n\n\nWe offer a toolkit to help you handle various types of visual input more conveniently, as if you were using an API. This includes base64, URLs, and interleaved images and videos. You can install it using the following command:\n\n```bash\n# It''s highly recommanded to use `[decord]` feature for faster video loading.\npip install qwen-vl-utils[decord]==0.0.8\n```\n\nIf you are not using Linux, you might not be able to install `decord` from PyPI. In that case, you can use `pip install qwen-vl-utils` which will fall back to using torchvision for video processing. However, you can still [install decord from source](https://github.com/dmlc/decord?tab=readme-ov-file#install-from-source) to get decord used when loading video.\n\n### Using 🤗  Transformers to

The details are in the table below. change the backend by `FORCE_QWENVL_VIDEO_READER=torchvision` or `FORCE_QWENVL_VIDEO_READER=decord` if you prefer not to use the default one.\n\n| Backend     | HTTP | HTTPS |\n|-------------|------|-------|\n| torchvision >= 0.19.0 | ✅  | ✅   |\n| torchvision < 0.19.0  | ❌  | ❌   |\n| decord      | ✅  | ❌   |\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Batch inference</summary>\n\n```python\n# Sample messages for batch inference\nmessages1 = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {"type": "image", "image": "file:///path/to/image1.jpg"},\n            {"type": "image", "image": "file:///path/to/image2.jpg"},\n            {"type": "text", "text": "What are the common elements in these pictures?"},\n        ],\n    }\n]\nmessages2 = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},\n    {"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"},\n]\n# Combine messages for batch processing\nmessages = [messages1, messages2]\n\n# Preparation for batch inference\ntexts = [\n    processor.apply_chat_template(msg, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)\n    for msg in messages\n]\nimage_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(messages)\ninputs = processor(\n    text=texts,\n    images=image_inputs,\n    videos=video_inputs,\n    padding=True,\n    return_tensors="pt",\n)\ninputs = inputs.to("cuda")\n\n# Batch Inference\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)\ngenerated_ids_trimmed = [\n    out_ids[len(in_ids) :] for in_ids, out_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n]\noutput_texts = processor.batch_decode(\n    generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False\n)\nprint(output_texts)\n```\n</details>\n\n### 🤖 ModelScope\nWe strongly advise users especially those in mainland China to use ModelScope. `snapshot_download` can help you solve issues concerning downloading checkpoints.\n\n\n### More Usage Tips\n\nFor input images, we support local files, base64, and URLs. For videos, we currently only support local files.\n\n```python\n# You can directly insert a local file path, a URL, or a base64-encoded image into the position where you want in the text.\n## Local file path\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {"type": "image", "image": "file:///path/to/your/image.jpg"},\n            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},\n        ],\n    }\n]\n## Image URL\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {"type": "image", "image": "http://path/to/your/image.jpg"},\n            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},\n        ],\n    }\n]\n## Base64 encoded image\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {"type": "image", "image": "data:image;base64,/9j/..."},\n            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},\n        ],\n    }\n]\n```\n#### Image Resolution for performance boost\n\nThe model supports a wide range of resolution inputs. By default, it uses the native resolution for input, but higher resolutions can enhance performance at the cost of more computation. Users can set the minimum and maximum number of pixels to achieve an optimal configuration for their needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage.\n\n```python\nmin_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28\nmax_pixels = 1280 * 28 * 28\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\n    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels\n)\n```\n\nBesides, We provide two methods for fine-grained control over the image size input to the model:\n\n1. Define min_pixels and max_pixels: Images will be resized to maintain their aspect ratio within the range of min_pixels and max_pixels.\n   \n2. Specify exact dimensions: Directly set `resized_height` and `resized_width`. These values will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 28.\n\n```python\n# min_pixels and max_pixels\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {\n                "type": "image",\n                "image": "file:///path/to/your/image.jpg",\n                "resized_height": 280,\n                "resized_width": 420,\n            },\n            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},\n        ],\n    }\n]\n# resized_height and resized_width\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {\n                "type": "image",\n                "image": "file:///path/to/your/image.jpg",\n                "min_pixels": 50176,\n                "max_pixels": 50176,\n            },\n            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},\n        ],\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Processing Long Texts\n\nThe current `config.json` is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.\nTo handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.\n\nFor supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:\n\n```\n{\n	...,\n    "type": "yarn",\n    "mrope_section": [\n        16,\n        24,\n        24\n    ],\n    "factor": 4,\n    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it should be noted that this method has a significant impact on the performance of temporal and spatial localization tasks, and is therefore not recommended for use.\n\nAt the same time, for long video inputs, since MRoPE itself is more economical with ids, the max_position_embeddings can be directly modified to a larger value, such as 64k.\n\n\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen2.5-VL,\n    title = {Qwen2.5-VL},\n    url =

During this period, we focused on building more useful vision-language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2.5-VL.\n\n#### Key Enhancements:\n* **Understand things visually**: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.\n\n* **Being agentic**: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.\n\n* **Understanding long videos and capturing events**: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of cpaturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.\n\n* **Capable of visual localization in different formats**: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.\n\n* **Generating structured outputs**: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.\n\n\n#### Model Architecture Updates:\n\n* **Dynamic Resolution and Frame Rate Training for Video Understanding**:\n\nWe extend dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension by adopting dynamic FPS sampling, enabling the model to comprehend videos at various sampling rates. Accordingly, we update mRoPE in the time dimension with IDs and absolute time alignment, enabling the model to learn temporal sequence and speed, and ultimately acquire the ability to pinpoint specific moments.\n\n<p align="center">\n    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-VL/qwen2.5vl_arc.jpeg" width="80%"/>\n<p>\n\n* **Streamlined and Efficient Vision Encoder**\n\nWe enhance both training and inference speeds by strategically implementing window attention into the ViT. The ViT architecture is further optimized with SwiGLU and RMSNorm, aligning it with the structure of the Qwen2.5 LLM.\n\n\nWe have three models with 3, 7 and 72 billion parameters. This repo contains the instruction-tuned 72B Qwen2.5-VL model. For more information, visit our [Blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL).\n\n\n\n## Evaluation\n\n### Image benchmark\n\n|      Benchmarks        | GPT4o     | Claude3.5 Sonnet  | Gemini-2-flash  | InternVL2.5-78B | Qwen2-VL-72B | Qwen2.5-VL-72B |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| MMMU<sub>val</sub>    | 70.3      | 70.4              | 70.7            | 70.1                 | 64.5         | 70.2          |\n| MMMU_Pro              | 54.5      | 54.7              | 57.0            | 48.6              | 46.2         | 51.1           |\n| MathVista_MINI        | 63.8      | 65.4              | 73.1            | 76.6                | 70.5         | 74.8           |\n| MathVision_FULL       | 30.4      | 38.3              | 41.3            | 32.2               | 25.9         | 38.1           |\n| Hallusion Bench       | 55.0      | 55.16             |                | 57.4             | 58.1         | 55.16           |\n| MMBench_DEV_EN_V11    | 82.1      | 83.4              | 83.0            | 88.5             | 86.6         | 88           |\n| AI2D_TEST             | 84.6      | 81.2              |                 | 89.1           | 88.1         | 88.4           |\n| ChartQA_TEST          | 86.7      | 90.8              | 85.2            | 88.3               | 88.3         | 89.5           |\n| DocVQA_VAL            | 91.1      | 95.2              | 92.1            | 96.5             | 96.1         |      96.4      |\n| MMStar                | 64.7      | 65.1              | 69.4            | 69.5             | 68.3         |       70.8         |\n| MMVet_turbo           | 69.1      |  70.1              |                 | 72.3           | 74.0         |       76.19         |\n| OCRBench              | 736       | 788               |                 | 854               | 877          |         885       |\n| OCRBench-V2(en/zh)    |  46.5/32.3 |  45.2/39.6         | 51.9/43.1       | 45/46.2     | 47.8/46.1    | 61.5/63.7    |\n| CC-OCR                | 66.6     | 62.7              | 73.0            | 64.7          | 68.7       |79.8           |\n\n\n### Video benchmark\n| Benchmarks          | GPT4o | Gemini-1.5-Pro | InternVL2.5-78B | Qwen2VL-72B | Qwen2.5VL-72B |\n|---------------------|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|\n| VideoMME w/o sub.   | 71.9  | 75.0           | 72.1            | 71.2        | 73.3          |\n| VideoMME w sub.     | 77.2  | 81.3           | 74.0            | 77.8        | 79.1          |\n| MVBench             | 64.6  | 60.5           | 76.4            | 73.6        | 70.4          |\n| MMBench-Video       | 1.63  | 1.30           | 1.97            | 1.70        | 2.02          |\n| LVBench             | 30.8  | 33.1           | -

This includes base64, URLs, and interleaved images and videos. You can install it using the following command:\n\n```bash\n# It''s highly recommanded to use `[decord]` feature for faster video loading.\npip install qwen-vl-utils[decord]==0.0.8\n```\n\nIf you are not using Linux, you might not be able to install `decord` from PyPI. In that case, you can use `pip install qwen-vl-utils` which will fall back to using torchvision for video processing. However, you can still [install decord from source](https://github.com/dmlc/decord?tab=readme-ov-file#install-from-source) to get decord used when loading video.\n\n### Using 🤗  Transformers to

For videos, we currently only support local files.\n\n```python\n# You can directly insert a local file path, a URL, or a base64-encoded image into the position where you want in the text.\n## Local file path\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {"type": "image", "image": "file:///path/to/your/image.jpg"},\n            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},\n        ],\n    }\n]\n## Image URL\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {"type": "image", "image": "http://path/to/your/image.jpg"},\n            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},\n        ],\n    }\n]\n## Base64 encoded image\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {"type": "image", "image": "data:image;base64,/9j/..."},\n            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},\n        ],\n    }\n]\n```\n#### Image Resolution for performance boost\n\nThe model supports a wide range of resolution inputs. By default, it uses the native resolution for input, but higher resolutions can enhance performance at the cost of more computation. Users can set the minimum and maximum number of pixels to achieve an optimal configuration for their needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage.\n\n```python\nmin_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28\nmax_pixels = 1280 * 28 * 28\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\n    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels\n)\n```\n\nBesides, We provide two methods for fine-grained control over the image size input to the model:\n\n1. Define min_pixels and max_pixels: Images will be resized to maintain their aspect ratio within the range of min_pixels and max_pixels.\n   \n2. Specify exact dimensions: Directly set `resized_height` and `resized_width`. These values will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 28.\n\n```python\n# min_pixels and max_pixels\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {\n

"text": "Describe this image."},\n        ],\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Processing Long Texts\n\nThe current `config.json` is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.\nTo handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.\n\nFor supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:\n\n```json\n{\n	...,\n    "type": "yarn",\n    "mrope_section": [\n        16,\n        24,\n        24\n    ],\n    "factor": 4,\n    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it should be noted that this method has a significant impact on the performance of temporal and spatial localization tasks, and is therefore not recommended for use.\n\nAt the same time, for long video inputs, since MRoPE itself is more economical with ids, the max_position_embeddings can be directly modified to a larger value, such as 64k.\n\n\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen2.5-VL,\n    title = {Qwen2.5-VL},\n    url =

As of now, Qwen2.5-Coder has covered six mainstream model sizes, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 7, 14, 32 billion parameters, to meet the needs of different developers. Qwen2.5-Coder brings the following improvements upon CodeQwen1.5:\n\n- Significantly improvements in **code generation**, **code reasoning** and **code fixing**. Base on the strong Qwen2.5, we scale up the training tokens into 5.5 trillion including source code, text-code grounding, Synthetic data, etc. Qwen2.5-Coder-32B has become the current state-of-the-art open-source codeLLM, with its coding abilities matching those of GPT-4o.\n- A more comprehensive foundation for real-world applications such as **Code Agents**. Not only enhancing coding capabilities but also maintaining its strengths in mathematics and general competencies.\n- **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens.\n\n**This repo contains the instruction-tuned 7B Qwen2.5-Coder model**, which has the following features:\n- Type: Causal Language Models\n- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training\n- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias\n- Number of Parameters: 7.61B\n- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B\n- Number of Layers: 28\n- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV\n- Context Length: Full 131,072 tokens\n  - Please refer to [this section](#processing-long-texts) for detailed instructions on how to deploy Qwen2.5 for handling long texts.\n  \nFor more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Coder), [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186).\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe code of Qwen2.5-Coder has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.\n\nWith `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:\n```\nKeyError: ''qwen2''\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\nHere provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct"\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype="auto",\n    device_map="auto"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nprompt = "write a quick sort algorithm."\nmessages = [\n    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant."},\n    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)\n\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=512\n)\ngenerated_ids = [\n    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n]\n\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n```\n\n### Processing Long Texts\n\nThe current `config.json` is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.\nTo handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.\n\nFor supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:\n```json\n{\n  ...,\n  "rope_scaling": {\n    "factor": 4.0,\n    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768,\n    "type": "yarn"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor deployment, we recommend using vLLM. \nPlease refer to our [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html) for usage if you are not familar with vLLM.\nPresently, vLLM only supports static YARN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts**. \nWe advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required.\n\n## Evaluation & Performance\n\nDetailed evaluation results are reported in this [📑 blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/).\n\nFor requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@article{hui2024qwen2,\n      title={Qwen2. 5-Coder Technical Report},\n      author={Hui, Binyuan and Yang, Jian and Cui, Zeyu and Yang, Jiaxi and Liu, Dayiheng and Zhang, Lei and Liu, Tianyu and Zhang, Jiajun and Yu, Bowen and Dang, Kai and others},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.12186},\n      year={2024}\n}\n@article{qwen2,\n      title={Qwen2 Technical Report}, \n      author={An Yang and Baosong Yang and Binyuan Hui and Bo Zheng and Bowen Yu and Chang Zhou and Chengpeng Li and Chengyuan Li and Dayiheng Liu and Fei Huang and Guanting Dong and Haoran Wei and Huan Lin and Jialong Tang and Jialin Wang and Jian Yang and Jianhong Tu and Jianwei Zhang and Jianxin Ma and Jin Xu and Jingren Zhou and Jinze Bai and Jinzheng He and Junyang Lin and Kai Dang and Keming Lu and Keqin Chen and Kexin Yang and Mei Li and Mingfeng Xue and Na Ni and Pei Zhang and Peng Wang and Ru Peng and Rui Men and Ruize Gao and Runji Lin and Shijie Wang and Shuai Bai and Sinan Tan and Tianhang Zhu and Tianhao Li and Tianyu Liu and Wenbin Ge and Xiaodong Deng and Xiaohuan Zhou and Xingzhang Ren and Xinyu Zhang and Xipin Wei and Xuancheng Ren and Yang Fan and Yang Yao and Yichang Zhang and Yu Wan and Yunfei Chu and Yuqiong Liu and Zeyu Cui and Zhenru Zhang and Zhihao Fan},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.10671},\n      year={2024}\n}\n```\n', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-generation","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":7615616512,"storage_bytes":30462543728,"files_count":14,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Qwen2ForCausalLM"],"model_type":"qwen2","tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":null,"chat_template":"{%- if tools %}\n    {{- ''<|im_start|>system\\n'' }}\n    {%- if messages[0][''role''] == ''system'' %}\n        {{- messages[0][''content''] }}\n    {%- else %}\n        {{- ''You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Please sign up to get **free and immediate** access to [NVIDIA NeMo Framework container](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-framework). If you don’t have an NVIDIA NGC account, you will be prompted to sign up for an account before proceeding.\n2. If you don’t have an NVIDIA NGC API key, sign into [NVIDIA NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup), selecting organization/team: ea-bignlp/ga-participants and click Generate API key. Save this key for the next step. Else, skip this step. \n3. On your machine, docker login to nvcr.io using\n   ```\n   docker login nvcr.io\n   Username: $oauthtoken\n   Password: <Your Saved NGC API Key>\n   ```\n4. Download the required container\n   ```\n   docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.05.llama3.1\n   ```\n   \n5. Download the checkpoint\n   ```\n   git lfs install\n   git clone https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct\n   ```\n\n6. Run Docker container\n   (In addition, to use Llama3.1 tokenizer, you need to ```export HF_HOME=<YOUR_HF_HOME_CONTAINING_TOKEN_WITH_LLAMA3.1_70B_ACCESS>```)\n   ```\n   docker run --gpus all -it --rm --shm-size=150g -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct:/opt/checkpoints/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct,${HF_HOME}:/hf_home -w /opt/NeMo nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.05.llama3.1\n   ```\n   \n7. Within the container, start the server in the background. This step does both conversion of the nemo checkpoint to TRT-LLM and then deployment using TRT-LLM. For an explanation of each argument and advanced usage, please refer to [NeMo FW Deployment Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/deployment/llm/in_framework.html)\n   \n   ```\n   HF_HOME=/hf_home python scripts/deploy/nlp/deploy_inframework_triton.py --nemo_checkpoint /opt/checkpoints/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct --model_type="llama" --triton_model_name nemotron --triton_http_address 0.0.0.0 --triton_port 8000 --num_gpus 2 --max_input_len 3072 --max_output_len 1024 --max_batch_size 1 &\n   ```\n   \n8.

We were excited to see a high-quality, openly available approach to parsing PDFs and other complex documents — and curious to explore what else might be possible using newer foundation models and some lightweight optimizations.\n\nThe result is **RolmOCR**, a drop-in alternative to olmOCR that’s faster, uses less memory, and still performs well on a variety of document types. We''re releasing it under **Apache 2.0** for anyone to try out, explore, or build on.\n\nThis model is a fine-tuned version of [Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) on the full [allenai/olmOCR-mix-0225](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/olmOCR-mix-0225) dataset.\n\n## Key changes\nWe made three notable changes: \n\n1. **New Base Model**: We swapped in a more recent version of the existing model (Qwen2.5-VL-7B) as the foundation.\n\n2. **No Metadata inputs**: Unlike the original, we don’t use metadata extracted from PDFs. This significantly reduces prompt length, which in turn lowers both processing time and VRAM usage — without hurting accuracy in most cases. \n\n3. **Rotation of training data:** About 15% of the training data was rotated to enhance robustness to off-angle documents. We otherwise use the same training set. \n\n## Usage\n\nHost your model with vLLM:\n```bash\nexport VLLM_USE_V1=1\nvllm serve reducto/RolmOCR \n```\n\nCall the model via openai compatible

The model provides uses for general purpose AI systems and applications which require:\n\n1) Memory/compute constrained environments\n2) Latency bound scenarios\n3) Strong reasoning (especially code, math and logic)\n\nOur model is designed to accelerate research on language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features. \n\n### Use Case Considerations\n\nOur models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fariness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high risk scenarios. Developers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case.\n\n***Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.*** \n\n## Usage\n\n### Requirements\nPhi-3.5-MoE-instruct is integrated in the official version of `transformers` starting from **4.46.0**. \nThe current `transformers` version can be verified with: `pip list | grep transformers`.\n\nExamples of required packages:\n```\nflash_attn==2.5.8\ntorch==2.3.1\naccelerate==0.31.0\ntransformers==4.46.0\n```\n\nPhi-3.5-MoE-instruct is also available in [Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/try-phi3.5moe)\n\n### Tokenizer\n\nPhi-3.5-MoE-Instruct supports a vocabulary size of up to `32064` tokens. The [tokenizer files](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-moe-instruct/blob/main/added_tokens.json) already provide placeholder tokens that can be used for downstream fine-tuning, but they can also be extended up to the model''s vocabulary size.\n\n### Input Formats\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct model is best suited for prompts using the chat format as follows:\n\n```\n<|system|>\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|end|>\n<|user|>\nHow to explain Internet for a medieval knight?<|end|>\n<|assistant|>\n```\n\n### Loading the model locally\nAfter obtaining the Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct model checkpoints, users can use this sample code for inference.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline \n\ntorch.random.manual_seed(0) \n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained( \n    "microsoft/Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct",  \n    device_map="cuda",  \n    torch_dtype="auto",  \n    trust_remote_code=False,  \n) \n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct") \n\nmessages = [ \n    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."}, \n    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you provide ways to eat combinations of bananas and dragonfruits?"}, \n    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure!

Moreover, the model outperforms bigger models in reasoning capability and only behind GPT-4o-mini. However, it is still fundamentally limited by its size for certain tasks. The model simply does not have the capacity to store too much factual knowledge, therefore, users may experience factual incorrectness. However, we believe such weakness can be resolved by augmenting Phi-3.5 with a search engine, particularly when using the model under RAG settings.\n\n### Multilingual\n\nThe table below highlights multilingual capability of Phi-3.5-MoE on multilingual MMLU, MEGA, and multilingual MMLU-pro datasets. Overall, we observed that even with just 6.6B active parameters, the model is very competitive on multilingual tasks in comparison to other models with a much bigger active parameters.\n\n| Category | Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct | Mistral-Nemo-12B-instruct-2407 | Llama-3.1-8B-instruct | Gemma-2-9b-It | Gemini-1.5-Flash | GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18 (Chat) |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n| Multilingual MMLU | 69.9 | 58.9 | 56.2 | 63.8 | 77.2 | 72.9 |\n| Multilingual MMLU-Pro | 45.3 | 34.0 | 21.4 | 43.0 | 57.9 | 53.2 |\n| MGSM | 58.7 | 63.3 | 56.7 | 75.1 | 75.8 | 81.7 |\n| MEGA MLQA | 65.3 | 61.2 | 45.2 | 54.4 | 61.6 | 70.0 |\n| MEGA TyDi QA | 67.1 | 63.7 | 54.5 | 65.6 | 63.6 | 81.8 |\n| MEGA UDPOS | 60.4 | 58.2 | 54.1 | 56.6 | 62.4 | 66.0 |\n| MEGA XCOPA | 76.6 | 10.8 | 21.1 | 31.2 | 95.0 | 90.3 |\n| MEGA XStoryCloze | 82.8 | 92.3 | 71.0 | 87.0 | 20.7 | 96.6 |\n| **Average** | **65.8** | **55.3** | **47.5** | **59.6** | **64.3** | **76.6** |\n\n### Long Context\n\nPhi-3.5-MoE supports 128K context length, therefore the model is capable of several long context tasks including long document/meeting summarization, long document QA, multilingual context retrieval. We see that Phi-3.5 is clearly better than Gemma-2 family which only supports 8K context length. Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct is very competitive with other much larger open-weight models such as Llama-3.1-8B-instruct, and Mistral-Nemo-12B-instruct-2407.\n\n| Benchmark | Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct | Mistral-Nemo-12B-instruct-2407 | Llama-3.1-8B-instruct | Gemini-1.5-Flash | GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18 (Chat) |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n| GovReport | 26.4 | 25.6 | 25.1 | 27.8 | 24.8 |\n| QMSum | 19.9 | 22.1 | 21.6 | 24.0 | 21.7 |\n| Qasper | 40.0 | 30.7 | 37.2 | 43.5 | 39.8 |\n| SQuALITY | 24.1 | 25.8 | 26.2 | 23.5 | 23.8 |\n| SummScreenFD | 16.9 | 18.2 | 17.6 | 16.3 | 17.0 |\n| **Average** | **25.5** | **24.5** | **25.5** | **27.0** | **25.4** |\n\nRULER: a retrieval-based benchmark for long context understanding\n| Model | 4K | 8K | 16K | 32K | 64K | 128K | Average |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n| Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct | 94.8 | 93 | 93.2 | 91.6 | 85.7 | 64.2 | **87.1** |\n| Llama-3.1-8B-instruct | 95.5 | 93.8 | 91.6 | 87.4 | 84.7 | 77.0 | **88.3** |\n| Mistral-Nemo-12B-instruct-2407 | 87.8 | 87.2 | 87.7 | 69.0 | 46.8 | 19.0 | **66.2** |\n\nRepoQA: a benchmark for long context code understanding\n| Model | Python | C++ | Rust | Java | TypeScript | Average |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n| Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct | 89 | 74 | 81 | 88 | 95 | **85** |\n| Llama-3.1-8B-instruct | 80 | 65 | 73 | 76 | 63 | **71** |\n| Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3 | 61 | 57 | 51 | 61 | 80 | **62** |\n\n## Training\n\n### Model\n\n**Architecture:** Phi-3.5-MoE has 16x3.8B parameters with **6.6B active parameters** when using 2 experts.

As an example, the result of a game in premier league in a particular day might be good training data for frontier models, but we need to remove such information to leave more model capacity for reasoning for the small size models. More details about data can be found in the [Phi-3 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14219).\n\n## Responsible AI Considerations\n\nLike other language models, the Phi family of models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:  \n* Quality of Service: The Phi models are trained primarily on English text and some additional multilingual text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance as well as performance disparities across non-English. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.\n* Multilingual performance and safety gaps: We believe it is important to make language models more widely available across different languages, but the Phi 3 models still exhibit challenges common across multilingual releases. As with any deployment of LLMs, developers will be better positioned to test for performance or safety gaps for their linguistic and cultural context and customize the model with additional fine-tuning and appropriate safeguards.\n* Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups, cultural contexts, or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases.\n* Inappropriate or Offensive Content: These models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case.\n* Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.\n* Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\n* Long Conversation: Phi-3 models, like other models, can in some cases generate responses that are repetitive, unhelpful, or inconsistent in very long chat sessions in both English and non-English languages. Developers are encouraged to place appropriate mitigations, like limiting conversation turns to account for the possible conversational drift\n\nDevelopers should apply responsible AI best practices, including mapping, measuring, and mitigating risks associated with their specific use case and cultural, linguistic context. Phi-3 family of models are general purpose models. As developers plan to deploy these models for specific use cases, they are encouraged to fine-tune the models for their use case and leverage the models as part of broader AI systems with language-specific safeguards in place. Important areas for consideration include: \n* Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.\n* High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess the suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context.\n* Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n* Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.\n* Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Safety Evaluation and Red-Teaming\n\nWe leveraged various evaluation techniques including red teaming, adversarial conversation simulations, and multilingual safety evaluation benchmark datasets to \nevaluate Phi-3.5 models'' propensity to produce undesirable outputs across multiple languages and risk categories. \nSeveral approaches were used to compensate for the limitations of one approach alone. Findings across the various evaluation methods indicate that safety \npost-training that was done as detailed in the [Phi-3 Safety Post-Training paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13833) had a positive impact across multiple languages and risk categories as observed by \nrefusal rates (refusal to output undesirable outputs) and robustness to jailbreak techniques. Note, however, while comprehensive red team evaluations were conducted \nacross all models in the prior release of Phi models, red teaming was largely focused on Phi-3.5 MOE across multiple languages and risk categories for this release as \nit is the largest and more capable model of the three models. Details on prior red team evaluations across Phi models can be found in the [Phi-3 Safety Post-Training paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13833). \nFor this release, insights from red teaming indicate that the models may refuse to generate undesirable outputs in English, even when the request for undesirable output \nis in another language. Models may also be more susceptible to longer multi-turn jailbreak techniques across both English and non-English languages. These findings \nhighlight the need for industry-wide investment in the development of high-quality safety evaluation datasets across multiple languages, including low resource languages, \nand risk areas that account for cultural nuances where those languages are spoken.\n\n## Software\n* [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)\n* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)\n* [Flash-Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention)\n\n## Hardware\nNote that by default, the Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run. We have tested on the following GPU types:\n* NVIDIA A100\n* NVIDIA A6000\n* NVIDIA H100\n  \n## License\nThe model is licensed under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).\n\n## Trademarks\nThis project may contain trademarks or logos for projects, products, or services.

inference pipelines.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Currently vLLM is capped at 32k context size because interleaved attention kernels for paged attention are not yet implemented in vLLM.\n> Attention kernels for paged attention are being worked on and as soon as it is fully supported in vLLM, this model card will be updated.\n> To take advantage of the full 128k context size we recommend [Mistral Inference](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410#mistral-inference)\n\n**_Installation_**\n\n\nMake sure you install `vLLM >= v0.6.4`:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade vllm\n```\n\nAlso make sure you have `mistral_common >= 1.4.4` installed:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade mistral_common\n```\n\nYou can also make use of a ready-to-go [docker image](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/Dockerfile).\n\n**_Offline_**\n\n```py\nfrom vllm import LLM\nfrom vllm.sampling_params import SamplingParams\n\nmodel_name = "mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410"\n\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(max_tokens=8192)\n\n# note that running Ministral 8B on a single GPU requires 24 GB of GPU RAM\n# If you want to divide the GPU requirement over multiple devices, please add *e.g.* `tensor_parallel=2`\nllm = LLM(model=model_name, tokenizer_mode="mistral", config_format="mistral", load_format="mistral")\n\nprompt = "Do we need to think for 10 seconds to find the answer of 1 + 1?"\n\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": prompt\n    },\n]\n\noutputs = llm.chat(messages, sampling_params=sampling_params)\n\nprint(outputs[0].outputs[0].text)\n# You don''t need to think for 10 seconds to find the answer to 1 + 1. The answer is 2,\n# and you can easily add these two numbers in your mind very quickly without any delay.\n```\n\n**_Server_**\n\nYou can also use Ministral-8B in a server/client setting. \n\n1. Spin up a server:\n\n\n```\nvllm serve mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 --tokenizer_mode mistral --config_format mistral --load_format mistral\n```\n\n**Note:** Running Ministral-8B on a single GPU requires 24 GB of GPU RAM. \n\nIf you want to divide the GPU requirement over multiple devices, please add *e.g.* `--tensor_parallel=2`\n\n2. And ping the client:\n\n```\ncurl --location ''http://<your-node-url>:8000/v1/chat/completions'' \\n--header ''Content-Type: application/json'' \\n--header ''Authorization: Bearer token'' \\n--data ''{\n    "model": "mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410",\n    "messages": [\n      {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": "Do we need to think for 10 seconds to find the answer of 1 + 1?"\n      }\n    ]\n}''\n\n```\n\n### Mistral-inference\n\nWe recommend using [mistral-inference](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference) to quickly try out / "vibe-check" the model.\n\n\n**_Install_**\n\nMake sure to have `mistral_inference >= 1.5.0` installed.\n\n```\npip install mistral_inference --upgrade\n```\n\n**_Download_**\n\n```py\nfrom huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nmistral_models_path = Path.home().joinpath(''mistral_models'', ''8B-Instruct'')\nmistral_models_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n\nsnapshot_download(repo_id="mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", allow_patterns=["params.json", "consolidated.safetensors", "tekken.json"], local_dir=mistral_models_path)\n```\n\n### Chat\n\nAfter installing `mistral_inference`, a `mistral-chat` CLI command should be available in your environment. You can chat with the model using\n\n```\nmistral-chat $HOME/mistral_models/8B-Instruct --instruct --max_tokens 256\n```\n\n### Passkey detection\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> In this example the passkey message has over >100k tokens and mistral-inference\n> does not have a chunked pre-fill mechanism. Therefore you will need a lot of\n> GPU memory in order to run the below example (80 GB). For a more memory-efficient\n> solution we recommend using vLLM.\n\n```py\nfrom mistral_inference.transformer import Transformer\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport json\nfrom mistral_inference.generate import generate\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\n\nfrom mistral_common.tokens.tokenizers.mistral import MistralTokenizer\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.messages import UserMessage\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.request import ChatCompletionRequest\n\ndef load_passkey_request() -> ChatCompletionRequest:\n    passkey_file = hf_hub_download(repo_id="mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", filename="passkey_example.json")\n\n    with open(passkey_file, "r") as f:\n        data = json.load(f)\n\n    message_content = data["messages"][0]["content"]\n    return ChatCompletionRequest(messages=[UserMessage(content=message_content)])\n\ntokenizer = MistralTokenizer.from_file(f"{mistral_models_path}/tekken.json")\nmodel = Transformer.from_folder(mistral_models_path, softmax_fp32=False)\n\ncompletion_request = load_passkey_request()\n\ntokens = tokenizer.encode_chat_completion(completion_request).tokens\n\nout_tokens, _ = generate([tokens], model, max_tokens=64, temperature=0.0, eos_id=tokenizer.instruct_tokenizer.tokenizer.eos_id)\nresult = tokenizer.instruct_tokenizer.tokenizer.decode(out_tokens[0])\n\nprint(result)  # The pass key is 13005.\n```\n\n\n### Instruct following\n\n```py\nfrom mistral_inference.transformer import Transformer\nfrom mistral_inference.generate import generate\n\nfrom mistral_common.tokens.tokenizers.mistral import MistralTokenizer\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.messages import UserMessage\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.request import ChatCompletionRequest\n\n\ntokenizer = MistralTokenizer.from_file(f"{mistral_models_path}/tekken.json")\nmodel = Transformer.from_folder(mistral_models_path)\n\ncompletion_request = ChatCompletionRequest(messages=[UserMessage(content="How often does the letter r occur in Mistral?")])\n\ntokens = tokenizer.encode_chat_completion(completion_request).tokens\n\nout_tokens, _ = generate([tokens], model, max_tokens=64, temperature=0.0, eos_id=tokenizer.instruct_tokenizer.tokenizer.eos_id)\nresult = tokenizer.instruct_tokenizer.tokenizer.decode(out_tokens[0])\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Function calling\n\n```py\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.tool_calls import Function, Tool\nfrom mistral_inference.transformer import Transformer\nfrom mistral_inference.generate import generate\n\nfrom mistral_common.tokens.tokenizers.mistral import MistralTokenizer\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.messages import UserMessage\nfrom mistral_common.protocol.instruct.request import ChatCompletionRequest\nfrom mistral_common.tokens.tokenizers.tekken import SpecialTokenPolicy\n\n\ntokenizer = MistralTokenizer.from_file(f"{mistral_models_path}/tekken.json")\ntekken = tokenizer.instruct_tokenizer.tokenizer\ntekken.special_token_policy = SpecialTokenPolicy.IGNORE\n\nmodel = Transformer.from_folder(mistral_models_path)\n\ncompletion_request = ChatCompletionRequest(\n    tools=[\n        Tool(\n            function=Function(\n                name="get_current_weather",\n                description="Get the current weather",\n                parameters={\n                    "type": "object",\n                    "properties": {\n                        "location": {\n                            "type": "string",\n                            "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",\n                        },\n                        "format": {\n                            "type": "string",\n                            "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],\n                            "description": "The temperature unit to use.

The model was trained from scratch by the research team at [Playground](https://playground.com). \n\nImages generated by Playground v2 are favored **2.5** times more than those produced by Stable Diffusion XL, according to Playground’s [user study](#user-study).\n\nWe are thrilled to release [intermediate checkpoints](#intermediate-base-models) at different training stages, including evaluation metrics, to the community. We hope this will encourage further research into foundational models for image generation.\n\nLastly, we introduce a new benchmark, [MJHQ-30K](#mjhq-30k-benchmark), for automatic evaluation of a model’s aesthetic quality.\n\nPlease see our [blog](https://blog.playgroundai.com/playground-v2/) for more details.\n\n### Model Description\n\n- **Developed by:** [Playground](https://playground.com)\n- **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generative model\n- **License:** [Playground v2 Community License](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic/blob/main/LICENSE.md)\n- **Summary:** This model generates images based on text prompts. It is a Latent Diffusion Model that uses two fixed, pre-trained text encoders ([OpenCLIP-ViT/G](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip) and [CLIP-ViT/L](https://github.com/openai/CLIP/tree/main)). It follows the same architecture as [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0).\n\n### Using the model with 🧨 Diffusers\n\nInstall diffusers >= 0.24.0 and some dependencies:\n```\npip install transformers accelerate safetensors\n```\n\nTo use the model, run the following snippet.\n\n**Note**: It is recommend to use **`guidance_scale=3.0`**.\n\n```python\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\nimport torch\n\npipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    "playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic",\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n    use_safetensors=True,\n    add_watermarker=False,\n    variant="fp16"\n)\npipe.to("cuda")\n\nprompt = "Astronaut in a jungle, cold color palette, muted colors, detailed, 8k"\nimage  = pipe(prompt=prompt, guidance_scale=3.0).images[0]\n```\n\n### Using the model with Automatic1111/ComfyUI\n\nIn order to use the model with software such as Automatic1111 or ComfyUI you can use [`playground-v2.fp16.safetensors`](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic/blob/main/playground-v2.fp16.safetensors) file.\n\n### User Study\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63855d851769b7c4b10e1f76/8VzBkSYaUU3dt509Co9sk.png)\n\nAccording to user studies conducted by Playground, involving over 2,600 prompts and thousands of users, the images generated by Playground v2 are favored **2.5** times more than those produced by [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0).\n\nWe report user preference metrics on [PartiPrompts](https://github.com/google-research/parti), following standard practice, and on an internal prompt dataset curated by the Playground team. The “Internal 1K” prompt dataset is diverse and covers various categories and tasks.\n\nDuring the user study, we give users instructions to evaluate image pairs based on both (1) their aesthetic preference and (2) the image-text alignment.\n\n### MJHQ-30K Benchmark\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63855d851769b7c4b10e1f76/o3Bt62qFsTO9DkeX2yLua.png)\n\n| Model                                 | Overall FID   |\n| ------------------------------------- | ----- |\n| SDXL-1-0-refiner                      | 9.55  |\n| [playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic)        | **7.07**  |\n\nWe introduce a new benchmark, [MJHQ-30K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/playgroundai/MJHQ-30K), for automatic evaluation of a model’s aesthetic quality. The benchmark computes FID on a high-quality dataset to gauge aesthetic quality.\n\nWe have curated a high-quality dataset from Midjourney, featuring 10 common categories, with each category containing 3,000 samples. Following common practice, we use aesthetic score and CLIP score to ensure high image quality and high image-text alignment. Furthermore, we take extra care to make the data diverse within each category.\n\nFor Playground v2, we report both the overall FID and per-category FID. All FID metrics are computed at resolution 1024x1024. Our benchmark results show that our model outperforms SDXL-1-0-refiner in overall FID and all category FIDs, especially in people and fashion categories. This is in line with the results of the user study, which indicates a correlation between human preference and FID score on the MJHQ-30K benchmark.\n\nWe release this benchmark to the public and encourage the community to adopt it for benchmarking their models’ aesthetic quality.\n\n### Intermediate Base Models\n\n| Model                        | FID    | Clip Score |\n| ---------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |\n| SDXL-1-0-refiner             | 13.04  | 32.62      |\n| [playground-v2-256px-base](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-256px-base)     | 9.83   | 31.90      |\n| [playground-v2-512px-base](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-512px-base)     | 9.55   | 32.08      |\n\n\nApart from [playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic), we release intermediate checkpoints at different training stages to the community in order to foster foundation model research in pixels. Here, we report the FID score and CLIP score on the MSCOCO14 evaluation set for the reference purposes. (Note that our reported numbers may differ from the numbers reported in SDXL’s published results, as our prompt list may be different.)\n\n### How to cite us\n\n```\n@misc{playground-v2,\n      url={[https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic)},\n      title={Playground v2},\n      author={Li, Daiqing and Kamko, Aleks and Sabet, Ali and Akhgari, Ehsan and Xu, Linmiao and Doshi, Suhail}\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"text-to-image","library_name":"diffusers","framework":"diffusers","params":null,"storage_bytes":76318365586,"files_count":35,"spaces_count":100,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"diffusers":{"_class_name":"StableDiffusionXLPipeline"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:mlfoundations:open_clip","source_url":"https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:CLIP","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/CLIP"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:google-research:parti","source_url":"https://github.com/google-research/parti"}]', NULL, 'Other', 'approved', 62.5, '776d436834d410b2dc60e7b99621a237', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

Designed for efficiency, SmolVLM can answer questions about images, describe visual content, create stories grounded on multiple images, or function as a pure language model without visual inputs. Its lightweight architecture makes it suitable for on-device applications while maintaining strong performance on multimodal tasks.\n\n## Model Summary\n\n- **Developed by:** Hugging Face 🤗\n- **Model type:** Multi-modal model (image+text)\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** English\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Architecture:** Based on [Idefics3](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/Idefics3-8B-Llama3) (see technical summary)\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Demo:** [SmolVLM Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM)\n- **Blog:** [Blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolvlm)\n\n## Uses\n\nSmolVLM can be used for inference on multimodal (image + text) tasks where the input comprises text queries along with one or more images. Text and images can be interleaved arbitrarily, enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and storytelling based on visual content. The model does not support image generation.\n\nTo fine-tune SmolVLM on a specific task, you can follow the fine-tuning tutorial.\n<!-- todo: add link to fine-tuning tutorial -->\n\n### Technical Summary\n\nSmolVLM leverages the lightweight SmolLM2 language model to provide a compact yet powerful multimodal experience. It introduces several changes compared to previous Idefics models:\n\n- **Image compression:** We introduce a more radical image compression compared to Idefics3 to enable the model to infer faster and use less RAM.\n- **Visual Token Encoding:** SmolVLM uses 81 visual tokens to encode image patches of size 384×384. Larger images are divided into patches, each encoded separately, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance.\n\nMore details about the training and architecture are available in our technical report.\n\n\n### How to get started\n\nYou can use transformers to load, infer and fine-tune SmolVLM.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForVision2Seq\nfrom transformers.image_utils import load_image\n\nDEVICE = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"\n\n# Load images\nimage1 = load_image("https://cdn.britannica.com/61/93061-050-99147DCE/Statue-of-Liberty-Island-New-York-Bay.jpg")\nimage2 = load_image("https://huggingface.co/spaces/merve/chameleon-7b/resolve/main/bee.jpg")\n\n# Initialize processor and model\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct")\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n    "HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct",\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n    _attn_implementation="flash_attention_2" if DEVICE == "cuda" else "eager",\n).to(DEVICE)\n\n# Create input messages\nmessages = [\n    {\n        "role": "user",\n        "content": [\n            {"type": "image"},\n            {"type": "image"},\n            {"type": "text", "text": "Can you describe the two images?"}\n        ]\n    },\n]\n\n# Prepare inputs\nprompt = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)\ninputs = processor(text=prompt, images=[image1, image2], return_tensors="pt")\ninputs = inputs.to(DEVICE)\n\n# Generate outputs\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=500)\ngenerated_texts = processor.batch_decode(\n    generated_ids,\n    skip_special_tokens=True,\n)\n\nprint(generated_texts[0])\n"""\nAssistant: The first image shows a green statue of the Statue of Liberty standing on a stone pedestal in front of a body of water. \nThe statue is holding a torch in its right hand and a tablet in its left hand. The water is calm and there are no boats or other objects visible. \nThe sky is clear and there are no clouds. The second image shows a bee on a pink flower. \nThe bee is black and yellow and is collecting pollen from the flower. The flower is surrounded by green leaves.\n"""\n```\n\n\n### Model optimizations\n\n**Precision**: For better performance, load and run the model in half-precision (`torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16`) if your hardware supports it.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForVision2Seq\nimport torch\n\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n    "HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct",\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n).to("cuda")\n```\n\nYou can also load SmolVLM with 4/8-bit quantization using bitsandbytes, torchao or Quanto. Refer to [this page](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/quantization) for other options.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForVision2Seq, BitsAndBytesConfig\nimport torch\n\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(\n    "HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct",\n    quantization_config=quantization_config,\n)\n```\n\n**Vision Encoder Efficiency**: Adjust the image resolution by setting `size={"longest_edge": N*384}` when initializing the processor, where N is your desired value. The default `N=4` works well, which results in input images of\nsize 1536×1536. For documents, `N=5` might be beneficial. Decreasing N can save GPU memory and is appropriate for lower-resolution images.

The model may produce content that appears factual but may not be accurate. Misuse includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Prohibited Uses:\n  - Evaluating or scoring individuals (e.g., in employment, education, credit)\n  - Critical automated decision-making\n  - Generating unreliable factual content\n- Malicious Activities:\n  - Spam generation\n  - Disinformation campaigns\n  - Harassment or abuse\n  - Unauthorized surveillance\n\n### License\n\nSmolVLM is built upon [the shape-optimized SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384) as image encoder and [SmolLM2](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct) for text decoder part.\n\nWe release the SmolVLM checkpoints under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\n## Training Details\n\n### Training Data\n\nThe training data comes from [The Cauldron](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceM4/the_cauldron) and [Docmatix](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceM4/Docmatix) datasets, with emphasis on document understanding (25%) and image captioning (18%), while maintaining balanced coverage across other crucial capabilities like visual reasoning, chart comprehension, and general instruction following.\n<img src="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct/resolve/main/mixture_the_cauldron.png" alt="Example Image" style="width:90%;" />\n\n\n\n\n## Evaluation\n\n| Model             | MMMU (val) | MathVista (testmini) | MMStar (val) | DocVQA (test) | TextVQA (val) | Min GPU RAM required (GB) |\n|-------------------|------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|\n| SmolVLM           | 38.8       | 44.6                | 42.1         | 81.6          | 72.7          | 5.02                      |\n| Qwen-VL 2B        | 41.1       | 47.8                | 47.5         | 90.1          | 79.7          | 13.70                     |\n| InternVL2 2B      | 34.3       | 46.3                | 49.8         | 86.9          | 73.4          | 10.52                     |\n| PaliGemma 3B 448px| 34.9       | 28.7                | 48.3         | 32.2          | 56.0          | 6.72                      |\n| moondream2        | 32.4       | 24.3                | 40.3         | 70.5          | 65.2          | 3.87                      |\n| MiniCPM-V-2       | 38.2       | 39.8                | 39.1         | 71.9          | 74.1          | 7.88                      |\n| MM1.5 1B          | 35.8       | 37.2                | 0.0          | 81.0          | 72.5          | NaN                       |\n\n# Citation information\nYou can cite us in the following way:\n```bibtex\n@article{marafioti2025smolvlm,\n  title={SmolVLM: Redefining small and efficient multimodal models}, \n  author={Andrés Marafioti and Orr Zohar and Miquel Farré and Merve Noyan and Elie Bakouch and Pedro Cuenca and Cyril Zakka and Loubna Ben Allal and Anton Lozhkov and Nouamane Tazi and Vaibhav Srivastav and Joshua Lochner and Hugo Larcher and Mathieu Morlon and Lewis Tunstall and Leandro von Werra and Thomas Wolf},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.05299},\n  year={2025}\n}\n```', '{"pipeline_tag":"image-text-to-text","library_name":"transformers","framework":"transformers","params":2246272880,"storage_bytes":45793562188,"files_count":43,"spaces_count":33,"gated":false,"private":false,"config":{"architectures":["Idefics3ForConditionalGeneration"],"model_type":"idefics3","processor_config":{"chat_template":"<|im_start|>{% for message in messages %}{{message[''role''] | capitalize}}{% if message[''content''][0][''type''] == ''image'' %}{{'':''}}{% else %}{{'': ''}}{% endif %}{% for line in message[''content''] %}{% if line[''type''] == ''text'' %}{{line[''text'']}}{% elif line[''type''] == ''image'' %}{{ ''<image>'' }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}<end_of_utterance>\n{% endfor %}{% if add_generation_prompt %}{{ ''Assistant:'' }}{% endif %}"},"tokenizer_config":{"bos_token":"<|im_start|>","eos_token":"<end_of_utterance>","pad_token":"<|im_end|>","chat_template":"<|im_start|>{% for message in messages %}{{message[''role''] | capitalize}}{% if message[''content''][0][''type''] == ''image'' %}{{'':''}}{% else %}{{'': ''}}{% endif %}{% for line in message[''content''] %}{% if line[''type''] == ''text'' %}{{line[''text'']}}{% elif line[''type''] == ''image'' %}{{ ''<image>'' }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}<end_of_utterance>\n{% endfor %}{% if add_generation_prompt %}{{ ''Assistant:'' }}{% endif %}","unk_token":"<|endoftext|>"}}}', '[]', '[{"type":"based_on_paper","target_id":"arxiv:2504.05299","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05299"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 62.5, '5414b7b0827faabc007108779722d231', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
