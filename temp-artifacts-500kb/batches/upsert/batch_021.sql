which runs entirely in the browser!_\n\n_Jump to the [quickstart](#quickstart) for a primer on our CLI._\n\n## A reactive programming environment\n\nmarimo guarantees your notebook code, outputs, and program state are consistent. This [solves many problems](https://docs.marimo.io/faq.html#faq-problems) associated with traditional notebooks like Jupyter.\n\n**A reactive programming environment.**\nRun a cell and marimo _reacts_ by automatically running the cells that\nreference its variables, eliminating the error-prone task of manually\nre-running cells. Delete a cell and marimo scrubs its variables from program\nmemory, eliminating hidden state.\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/reactive.gif" width="700px" />\n\n<a name="expensive-notebooks"></a>\n\n**Compatible with expensive notebooks.** marimo lets you [configure the runtime\nto be\nlazy](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/configuration/runtime_configuration.html),\nmarking affected cells as stale instead of automatically running them. This\ngives you guarantees on program state while preventing accidental execution of\nexpensive cells.\n\n**Synchronized UI elements.** Interact with [UI\nelements](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/interactivity.html) like [sliders](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/slider.html#slider),\n[dropdowns](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/dropdown.html), [dataframe\ntransformers](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/dataframe.html), and [chat\ninterfaces](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/chat.html), and the cells that\nuse them are automatically re-run with their latest values.\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/readme-ui.gif" width="700px" />\n\n**Interactive dataframes.** [Page through, search, filter, and\nsort](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/dataframes.html)\nmillions of rows blazingly fast, no code required.\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/docs-df.gif" width="700px" />\n\n**Generate cells with data-aware AI.** [Generate code with an AI\nassistant](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/editor_features/ai_completion/) that is highly\nspecialized for working with data, with context about your variables in memory;\n[zero-shot entire notebooks](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/generate_with_ai/text_to_notebook/).\nCustomize the system prompt, bring your own API keys, or use local models.\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/readme-generate-with-ai.gif" width="700px" />\n\n**Query data with SQL.** Build [SQL](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/sql.html) queries\nthat depend on Python values and execute them against dataframes, databases, lakehouses,\nCSVs, Google Sheets, or anything else using our built-in SQL engine, which\nreturns the result as a Python dataframe.\n\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/readme-sql-cell.png" width="700px" />\n\nYour notebooks are still pure Python, even if they use SQL.\n\n**Dynamic markdown.** Use markdown parametrized by Python variables to tell\ndynamic stories that depend on Python data.\n\n**Built-in package management.** marimo has built-in support for all major\npackage managers, letting you [install packages on import](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/editor_features/package_management.html). marimo can even\n[serialize package\nrequirements](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/package_management/inlining_dependencies/)\nin notebook files, and auto install them in\nisolated venv sandboxes.\n\n**Deterministic execution order.** Notebooks are executed in a deterministic\norder, based on variable references instead of cells'' positions on the page.\nOrganize your notebooks to best fit the stories you''d like to tell.\n\n**Performant runtime.** marimo runs only those cells that need to be run by\nstatically analyzing your code.\n\n**Batteries-included.** marimo comes with GitHub Copilot, AI assistants, Ruff\ncode formatting, HTML export, fast code completion, a [VS Code\nextension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marimo-team.vscode-marimo),\nan interactive dataframe viewer, and [many more](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/editor_features/index.html)\nquality-of-life features.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n_The [marimo concepts\nplaylist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N6lInzq5MI&list=PLNJXGo8e1XT9jP7gPbRdm1XwloZVFvLEq)\non our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@marimo-team) gives an\noverview of many features._\n\n**Installation.** In a terminal, run\n\n```bash\npip install marimo  #

Ensure `vm.max_map_count` >= 262144:\n\n   > To check the value of `vm.max_map_count`:\n   >\n   > ```bash\n   > $ sysctl vm.max_map_count\n   > ```\n   >\n   > Reset `vm.max_map_count` to a value at least 262144 if it is not.\n   >\n   > ```bash\n   > # In this case, we set it to 262144:\n   > $ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144\n   > ```\n   >\n   > This change will be reset after a system reboot. To ensure your change remains permanent, add or update the\n   > `vm.max_map_count` value in **/etc/sysctl.conf** accordingly:\n   >\n   > ```bash\n   > vm.max_map_count=262144\n   > ```\n   >\n2. Clone the repo:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git\n   ```\n3. Start up the server using the pre-built Docker images:\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> All Docker images are built for x86 platforms. We don''t currently offer Docker images for ARM64.\n> If you are on an ARM64 platform, follow [this guide](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/build_docker_image) to build a Docker image compatible with your system.\n\n> The command below downloads the `v0.22.1` edition of the RAGFlow Docker image. See the following table for descriptions of different RAGFlow editions. To download a RAGFlow edition different from `v0.22.1`, update the `RAGFLOW_IMAGE` variable accordingly in **docker/.env** before using `docker compose` to start the server.\n\n```bash\n   $ cd ragflow/docker\n  \n   # git checkout v0.22.1\n   # Optional: use a stable tag (see releases: https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/releases)\n   # This step ensures the **entrypoint.sh** file in the code matches the Docker image version.\n   \n   # Use CPU for DeepDoc tasks:\n   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d\n\n   # To use GPU to accelerate DeepDoc tasks:\n   # sed -i ''1i DEVICE=gpu'' .env\n   # docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d\n```\n\n> Note: Prior to `v0.22.0`, we provided both images with embedding models and slim images without embedding models. Details as follows:\n\n| RAGFlow image tag | Image size (GB) | Has embedding models? | Stable?                  |\n| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| v0.21.1           | &approx;9       | ✔️                    | Stable release           |\n| v0.21.1-slim      | &approx;2       | ❌                    | Stable release           |\n\n> Starting with `v0.22.0`, we ship only the slim edition and no longer append the **-slim** suffix to the image tag.\n\n4. Check the server status after having the server up and running:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ docker logs -f docker-ragflow-cpu-1\n   ```\n\n   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_\n\n   ```bash\n\n         ____   ___    ______ ______ __\n        / __ \ /   |  / ____// ____// /____  _      __\n       / /_/ // /| | / / __ / /_   / // __ \| | /| / /\n      / _, _// ___ |/ /_/ // __/  / // /_/ /| |/ |/ /\n     /_/ |_|/_/  |_|\____//_/    /_/ \____/ |__/|__/\n\n    * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)\n   ```\n\n   > If you skip this confirmation step and directly log in to RAGFlow, your browser may prompt a `network anormal`\n   > error because, at that moment, your RAGFlow may not be fully initialized.\n   >\n5. In your web browser, enter the IP address of your server and log in to RAGFlow.\n\n   > With the default settings, you only need to enter `http://IP_OF_YOUR_MACHINE` (**sans** port number) as the default\n   > HTTP serving port `80` can be omitted when using the default configurations.\n   >\n6. In [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template), select the desired LLM factory in `user_default_llm` and update\n   the `API_KEY` field with the corresponding API key.\n\n   > See [llm_api_key_setup](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/llm_api_key_setup) for more information.\n   >\n\n   _The show is on!_\n\n## 🔧 Configurations\n\nWhen it comes to system configurations, you will need to manage the following files:\n\n- [.env](./docker/.env): Keeps the fundamental setups for the system, such as `SVR_HTTP_PORT`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and\n  `MINIO_PASSWORD`.\n- [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template): Configures the back-end services. The environment variables in this file will be automatically populated when the Docker container starts. Any environment variables set within the Docker container will be available for use, allowing you to customize service behavior based on the deployment environment.\n- [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml): The system relies on [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) to start up.\n\n> The [./docker/README](./docker/README.md) file provides a detailed description of the environment settings and service\n> configurations which can be used as `${ENV_VARS}` in the [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template) file.\n\nTo update the default HTTP serving port (80), go to [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) and change `80:80`\nto `<YOUR_SERVING_PORT>:80`.\n\nUpdates to the above configurations require a reboot of all containers to take effect:\n\n> ```bash\n> $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d\n> ```\n\n### Switch doc engine from Elasticsearch to Infinity\n\nRAGFlow uses Elasticsearch by default for storing full text and vectors. To switch to [Infinity](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/), follow these steps:\n\n1. Stop all running containers:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v\n   ```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> `-v` will delete the docker container volumes, and the existing data will be cleared.\n\n2. Set `DOC_ENGINE` in **docker/.env** to `infinity`.\n3. Start the containers:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d\n   ```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Switching to Infinity on a Linux/arm64 machine is not yet officially supported.\n\n## 🔧 Build a Docker image\n\nThis image is approximately 2 GB in size and relies on external LLM and embedding services.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git\ncd ragflow/\ndocker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly .\n```\n\n## 🔨 Launch service from source for development\n\n1. Install `uv` and `pre-commit`, or skip this step if they are already installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipx install uv pre-commit\n   ```\n2. Clone the source code and install Python dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git\n   cd ragflow/\n   uv sync --python 3.10 # install RAGFlow dependent python modules\n   uv run download_deps.py\n   pre-commit install\n   ```\n3. Launch the dependent services (MinIO, Elasticsearch, Redis, and MySQL) using Docker Compose:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-base.yml up -d\n   ```\n\n   Add the following line to `/etc/hosts` to resolve all hosts specified in **docker/.env** to `127.0.0.1`:\n\n   ```\n   127.0.0.1       es01 infinity mysql minio redis sandbox-executor-manager\n   ```\n4. If you cannot access HuggingFace, set the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable to use a mirror site:\n\n   ```bash\n   export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com\n   ```\n5. If your operating system does not have jemalloc, please install it as follows:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Ubuntu\n   sudo apt-get install libjemalloc-dev\n   # CentOS\n   sudo yum install jemalloc\n   # OpenSUSE\n   sudo zypper install jemalloc\n   # macOS\n   sudo brew install jemalloc\n   ```\n6. Launch backend service:\n\n   ```bash\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)\n   bash docker/launch_backend_service.sh\n   ```\n7. Install frontend dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd web\n   npm install\n   ```\n8. Launch frontend service:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run dev\n   ```\n\n   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_\n\n   ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0daf462c-a24d-4496-a66f-92533534e187)\n9. Stop RAGFlow front-end and back-end service after development is complete:\n\n   ```bash\n   pkill -f "ragflow_server.py|task_executor.py"\n   ```\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\n- [Quickstart](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/)\n- [Configuration](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/configurations)\n- [Release notes](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/release_notes)\n- [User guides](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/category/guides)\n- [Developer guides](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/category/developers)\n- [References](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/category/references)\n- [FAQs](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/faq)\n\n## 📜 Roadmap\n\nSee the [RAGFlow Roadmap 2025](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/issues/4214)\n\n## 🏄 Community\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/NjYzJD3GM3)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/infiniflowai)\n- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/infiniflow/discussions)\n\n## 🙌 Contributing\n\nRAGFlow flourishes via open-source collaboration.

Many SaaS apps (often paying) will give you a better audio quality than this repository will. If you wish for an open-source solution with a high voice quality:\n\n- Check out [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/task/speech-synthesis/) for other repositories and recent research in the field of speech synthesis.\n- Check out [Chatterbox](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox) for a similar project up to date with the 2025 SOTA in voice cloning\n\n## Running the toolbox\n\nBoth Windows and Linux are supported.\n1. Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages). This is necessary for reading audio files. Check if it''s installed by running in a command line\n```\nffmpeg\n```\n2. Install uv for python package management\n```\n# On Windows:\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"\n# On Linux\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# Alternatively, on any platform if you have pip installed you can do\npip install -U uv\n```\n3. Run one of the following commands\n```\n# Run the toolbox if you have an NVIDIA GPU\nuv run --extra cuda demo_toolbox.py\n# Use this if you don''t\nuv run --extra cpu demo_toolbox.py\n\n# Run in command line if you don''t want the GUI\nuv run --extra cuda demo_cli.py\nuv run --extra cpu demo_cli.py\n```\nUv will automatically create a .venv directory for you with an appropriate python environment. [Open an issue](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/issues) if this fails for you\n\n### (Optional) Download Pretrained Models\n\nPretrained models are now downloaded automatically. If this doesn''t work for you, you can manually download them [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Pretrained-models).\n\n### (Optional) Download Datasets\n\nFor playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading [`LibriSpeech/train-clean-100`](https://www.openslr.org/resources/12/train-clean-100.tar.gz). Extract the contents as `<datasets_root>/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100` where `<datasets_root>` is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Training#datasets). You''re free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":58981,"forks":9391,"watchers":58981,"open_issues":172,"topics":["deep-learning","python","pytorch","tensorflow","tts","voice-cloning"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":369680,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:fatchord:WaveRNN","source_url":"https://github.com/fatchord/WaveRNN"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:fatchord:WaveRNN","source_url":"https://github.com/fatchord/WaveRNN"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:resemble-ai:chatterbox","source_url":"https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:CorentinJ:Real-Time-Voice-Cloning","source_url":"https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:CorentinJ:Real-Time-Voice-Cloning","source_url":"https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:CorentinJ:Real-Time-Voice-Cloning","source_url":"https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning"}]', NULL, 'NOASSERTION', 'approved', 65, '072f82d256fbe882b3f3b139e090f96e', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

ghcr.io/coqui-ai/tts-cpu\npython3 TTS/server/server.py --list_models #To get the list of available models\npython3 TTS/server/server.py --model_name tts_models/en/vctk/vits # To start a server\n```\n\nYou can then enjoy the TTS server [here](http://[::1]:5002/)\nMore details about the docker images (like GPU support) can be found [here](https://tts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker_images.html)\n\n\n## Synthesizing speech by 🐸TTS\n\n### 🐍 Python API\n\n#### Running a multi-speaker and multi-lingual model\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom TTS.api import TTS\n\n# Get device\ndevice = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"\n\n# List available 🐸TTS models\nprint(TTS().list_models())\n\n# Init TTS\ntts = TTS("tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2").to(device)\n\n# Run TTS\n# ❗ Since this model is multi-lingual voice cloning model, we must set the target speaker_wav and language\n# Text to speech list of amplitude values as output\nwav = tts.tts(text="Hello world!", speaker_wav="my/cloning/audio.wav", language="en")\n# Text to speech to a file\ntts.tts_to_file(text="Hello world!", speaker_wav="my/cloning/audio.wav", language="en", file_path="output.wav")\n```\n\n#### Running a single speaker model\n\n```python\n# Init TTS with the target model name\ntts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/de/thorsten/tacotron2-DDC", progress_bar=False).to(device)\n\n# Run TTS\ntts.tts_to_file(text="Ich bin eine Testnachricht.", file_path=OUTPUT_PATH)\n\n# Example voice cloning with YourTTS in English, French and Portuguese\ntts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/your_tts", progress_bar=False).to(device)\ntts.tts_to_file("This is voice cloning.", speaker_wav="my/cloning/audio.wav", language="en", file_path="output.wav")\ntts.tts_to_file("C''est le clonage de la voix.", speaker_wav="my/cloning/audio.wav", language="fr-fr", file_path="output.wav")\ntts.tts_to_file("Isso é clonagem de voz.", speaker_wav="my/cloning/audio.wav", language="pt-br", file_path="output.wav")\n```\n\n#### Example voice conversion\n\nConverting the voice in `source_wav` to the voice of `target_wav`\n\n```python\ntts = TTS(model_name="voice_conversion_models/multilingual/vctk/freevc24", progress_bar=False).to("cuda")\ntts.voice_conversion_to_file(source_wav="my/source.wav", target_wav="my/target.wav", file_path="output.wav")\n```\n\n#### Example voice cloning together with the voice conversion model.\nThis way, you can clone voices by using any model in 🐸TTS.\n\n```python\n\ntts = TTS("tts_models/de/thorsten/tacotron2-DDC")\ntts.tts_with_vc_to_file(\n    "Wie sage ich auf Italienisch, dass ich dich liebe?",\n    speaker_wav="target/speaker.wav",\n    file_path="output.wav"\n)\n```\n\n#### Example text to speech using **Fairseq models in ~1100 languages** 🤯.\nFor Fairseq models, use the following name format: `tts_models/<lang-iso_code>/fairseq/vits`.\nYou can find the language ISO codes [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/mms/tts/all-tts-languages.html)\nand learn about the Fairseq models [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/mms).\n\n```python\n# TTS with on the fly voice conversion\napi = TTS("tts_models/deu/fairseq/vits")\napi.tts_with_vc_to_file(\n    "Wie sage ich auf Italienisch, dass ich dich liebe?",\n    speaker_wav="target/speaker.wav",\n    file_path="output.wav"\n)\n```\n\n### Command-line `tts`\n\n<!-- begin-tts-readme -->\n\nSynthesize speech on command line.\n\nYou can either use your trained model or choose a model from the provided list.\n\nIf you don''t specify any models, then it uses LJSpeech based English model.\n\n#### Single Speaker Models\n\n- List provided models:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --list_models\n  ```\n\n- Get model info (for both tts_models and vocoder_models):\n\n  - Query by type/name:\n    The model_info_by_name uses the name as it from the --list_models.\n    ```\n    $ tts --model_info_by_name "<model_type>/<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>"\n    ```\n    For example:\n    ```\n    $ tts --model_info_by_name tts_models/tr/common-voice/glow-tts\n    $ tts --model_info_by_name vocoder_models/en/ljspeech/hifigan_v2\n    ```\n  - Query by type/idx:\n    The model_query_idx uses the corresponding idx from --list_models.\n\n    ```\n    $ tts --model_info_by_idx "<model_type>/<model_query_idx>"\n    ```\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```\n    $ tts --model_info_by_idx tts_models/3\n    ```\n\n  - Query info for model info by full name:\n    ```\n    $ tts --model_info_by_name "<model_type>/<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>"\n    ```\n\n- Run TTS with default models:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --out_path output/path/speech.wav\n  ```\n\n- Run TTS and pipe out the generated TTS wav file data:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --pipe_out --out_path output/path/speech.wav | aplay\n  ```\n\n- Run a TTS model with its default vocoder model:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --model_name "<model_type>/<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>" --out_path output/path/speech.wav\n  ```\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --model_name "tts_models/en/ljspeech/glow-tts" --out_path output/path/speech.wav\n  ```\n\n- Run with specific TTS and vocoder models from the list:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --model_name "<model_type>/<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>" --vocoder_name "<model_type>/<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>" --out_path output/path/speech.wav\n  ```\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --model_name "tts_models/en/ljspeech/glow-tts" --vocoder_name "vocoder_models/en/ljspeech/univnet" --out_path output/path/speech.wav\n  ```\n\n- Run your own TTS model (Using Griffin-Lim Vocoder):\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --model_path path/to/model.pth --config_path path/to/config.json --out_path output/path/speech.wav\n  ```\n\n- Run your own TTS and Vocoder models:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --model_path path/to/model.pth --config_path path/to/config.json --out_path output/path/speech.wav\n      --vocoder_path path/to/vocoder.pth --vocoder_config_path path/to/vocoder_config.json\n  ```\n\n#### Multi-speaker Models\n\n- List the available speakers and choose a <speaker_id> among them:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --model_name "<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>"  --list_speaker_idxs\n  ```\n\n- Run the multi-speaker TTS model with the target speaker ID:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS." --out_path output/path/speech.wav --model_name "<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>"  --speaker_idx <speaker_id>\n  ```\n\n- Run your own multi-speaker TTS model:\n\n  ```\n  $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --out_path output/path/speech.wav --model_path path/to/model.pth --config_path path/to/config.json --speakers_file_path path/to/speaker.json --speaker_idx <speaker_id>\n  ```\n\n### Voice Conversion Models\n\n```\n$ tts --out_path output/path/speech.wav --model_name "<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>" --source_wav <path/to/speaker/wav> --target_wav <path/to/reference/wav>\n```\n\n<!-- end-tts-readme -->\n\n## Directory Structure\n```\n|- notebooks/       (Jupyter Notebooks for model evaluation, parameter selection and data analysis.)\n|- utils/

The tests were run on both 8-card and 16-card configurations for 7B and 70B models, respectively.\n\n|              GPU              |  GPUs  | Model Size |    Parallelism    | Batch Size per DP | Seqlen | Throughput | TFLOPS/GPU  | Peak Mem(MiB)  |\n| :-----------------------------: | :--------: | :-------------: | :------------------: | :-----------: | :--------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |\n|         H200            |     8     |      7B       |   zero2(dp8)     | 36 |        4096     |       17.13 samp/s     |       534.18     |       119040.02     |\n|         H200            |     16     |      70B       |   zero2     | 48 |        4096     |       3.27 samp/s     |       469.1     |       150032.23     |\n|         B200            |     8     |      7B       |   zero1(dp2)+tp2+pp4     | 128 |        4096     |       25.83 samp/s     |       805.69     |       100119.77     |\n|         H200            |     16     |      70B       |   zero1(dp2)+tp2+pp4     | 128 |        4096     |       5.66 samp/s     |       811.79     |       100072.02     |\n\nThe results from the Colossal-AI benchmark provide the most practical insight. For the 7B model on 8 cards, the **B200 achieved a 50% higher throughput** and a significant increase in TFLOPS per GPU. For the 70B model on 16 cards, the B200 again demonstrated a clear advantage, with **over 70% higher throughput and TFLOPS per GPU**.

This allows you to access the unreleased features and bug fixes in the main branch.\nInstallation can be made via\n\n```bash\npip install colossalai-nightly\n```\n\n### Download From Source\n\n> The version of Colossal-AI will be in line with the main branch of the repository. Feel free to raise an issue if you encounter any problems. :)\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI.git\ncd ColossalAI\n\n# install colossalai\npip install .\n```\n\nBy default, we do not compile CUDA/C++ kernels. ColossalAI will build them during runtime.\nIf you want to install and enable CUDA kernel fusion (compulsory installation when using fused optimizer):\n\n```shell\nBUILD_EXT=1 pip install .\n```\n\nFor Users with CUDA 10.2, you can still build ColossalAI from source. However, you need to manually download the cub library and copy it to the corresponding directory.\n\n```bash\n# clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI.git\ncd ColossalAI\n\n# download the cub library\nwget https://github.com/NVIDIA/cub/archive/refs/tags/1.8.0.zip\nunzip 1.8.0.zip\ncp -r cub-1.8.0/cub/ colossalai/kernel/cuda_native/csrc/kernels/include/\n\n# install\nBUILD_EXT=1 pip install .\n```\n\n<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n## Use Docker\n\n### Pull from DockerHub\n\nYou can directly pull the docker image from our [DockerHub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/hpcaitech/colossalai). The image is automatically uploaded upon release.\n\n\n### Build On Your Own\n\nRun the following command to build a docker image from Dockerfile provided.\n\n> Building Colossal-AI from scratch requires GPU support, you need to use Nvidia Docker Runtime as the default when doing `docker build`. More details can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59691207/docker-build-with-nvidia-runtime).\n> We recommend you install Colossal-AI from our [project page](https://www.colossalai.org) directly.\n\n\n```bash\ncd ColossalAI\ndocker build -t colossalai ./docker\n```\n\nRun the following command to start the docker container in interactive mode.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -ti --gpus all --rm --ipc=host colossalai bash\n```\n\n<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n## Community\n\nJoin the Colossal-AI community on [Forum](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/discussions),\n[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/colossalaiworkspace/shared_invite/zt-z7b26eeb-CBp7jouvu~r0~lcFzX832w),\nand [WeChat(微信)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcaitech/public_assets/main/colossalai/img/WeChat.png "qrcode") to share your suggestions, feedback, and questions with our engineering team.\n\n## Contributing\nReferring to the successful attempts of [BLOOM](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) and [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion), any and all developers and partners with computing powers, datasets, models are welcome to join and build the Colossal-AI community, making efforts towards the era of big AI models!\n\nYou may contact us or participate in the following ways:\n1.

However, the best practice for choosing the optimal parallel strategy is still lacking, as it requires domain expertise in both deep learning and parallel computing. The Colossal-AI system addressed the above challenge by introducing a unified interface to scale your sequential code of model training to distributed environments. It supports parallel training methods such as data, pipeline, tensor, and sequence parallelism and is integrated with heterogeneous training and zero redundancy optimizer. Compared to the baseline system, Colossal-AI can achieve up to 2.76 times training speedup on large-scale models.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 52nd International Conference on Parallel

([Demo](http://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/))\n\nImage Recognition\n\n[![fancy demo gif](./docs/images/demo.gif)](http://tesseract.projectnaptha.com)\n\nVideo Real-time Recognition\n\n<p align="center">\n  <a href="https://github.com/jeromewu/tesseract.js-video"><img alt="Tesseract.js Video" src="./docs/images/video-demo.gif"></a>\n</p>\n\nTesseract.js works in the browser using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), esm, or plain script tags with a [CDN](#CDN) and on the server with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).\nAfter you [install it](#installation), using it is as simple as:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createWorker } from ''tesseract.js'';\n\n(async () => {\n  const worker = await createWorker(''eng'');\n  const ret = await worker.recognize(''https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng_bw.png'');\n  console.log(ret.data.text);\n  await worker.terminate();\n})();\n```\nWhen recognizing multiple images, users should create a worker once, run `worker.recognize` for each image, and then run `worker.terminate()` once at the end (rather than running the above snippet for every image). \n\n## Installation\nTesseract.js works with a `<script>` tag via local copy or CDN, with webpack via `npm` and on Node.js with `npm/yarn`.\n\n### CDN\n```html\n<!-- v5 -->\n<script src=''https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tesseract.js@5/dist/tesseract.min.js''></script>\n```\nAfter including the script the `Tesseract` variable will be globally available and a worker can be created using `Tesseract.createWorker`.\n\nAlternatively, an ESM build (used with `import` syntax) can be found at `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tesseract.js@5/dist/tesseract.esm.min.js`. \n\n### Node.js\n\n**Requires Node.js v14 or higher**\n\n```shell\n# For latest version\nnpm install tesseract.js\nyarn add tesseract.js\n\n# For old versions\nnpm install tesseract.js@3.0.3\nyarn add tesseract.js@3.0.3\n```\n\n## Project Scope\nTesseract.js aims to bring the [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) OCR engine (a separate project) to the browser and Node.js, and works by wrapping a [WebAssembly port](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js-core) of Tesseract.  This project does not modify core Tesseract features.  Most notably, **Tesseract.js does not support PDF files and does not modify the Tesseract recognition model to improve accuracy.**\n\nIf your project requires features outside of this scope, consider the [Scribe.js library](https://github.com/scribeocr/scribe.js).  Scribe.js is an alternative library created to accommodate common feature requests that are outside of the scope of this repo.  Scribe.js includes improvements to the Tesseract recognition model and supports extracting text from PDF documents, among other features.  For more information see [Scribe.js vs. Tesseract.js](https://github.com/scribeocr/scribe.js/blob/master/docs/scribe_vs_tesseract.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Workers vs. Schedulers](./docs/workers_vs_schedulers.md)\n* [Examples](./docs/examples.md)\n* [Supported Image Formats](./docs/image-format.md)\n* [API](./docs/api.md)\n* [Local Installation](./docs/local-installation.md)\n* [FAQ](./docs/faq.md)\n\n## Community Projects and Examples\nThe following are examples and projects built by the community using Tesseract.js. Officially supported examples are found in the [examples](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/tree/master/examples) directory. \n\n- Projects\n   - Scribe OCR: web application for scanning documents (images and PDFs)\n      - Site at [scribeocr.com](https://scribeocr.com/), repo at [github.com/scribeocr/scribeocr](https://github.com/scribeocr/scribeocr)\n   - Chrome Extension (with Manifest V3): https://github.com/Tshetrim/Image-To-Text-OCR-extension-for-ChatGPT\n- Examples\n   - Converting PDF to text: https://github.com/racosa/pdf2text-ocr\n   - Use `blocks` output to generate granular data [word/symbol level]: https://github.com/Kishlay-notabot/tesseract-bbox-examples\n   - Electron: https://github.com/Balearica/tesseract.js-electron\n   - Typescript: https://github.com/Balearica/tesseract.js-typescript\n \nIf you have a project or example repo that uses Tesseract.js, feel free to add it to this list using a pull request. Examples submitted should be well documented such that new users can run them; projects should be functional and actively maintained.\n\n## Major changes in v6\nVersion 6 changes are documented in [this issue](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/issues/993).  Highlights are below.\n - Fixed memory leak in previous versions\n - Overall reductions in runtime and memory usage\n - Breaking changes:\n    - All outputs formats other than `text` are disabled by default.\n      - To re-enable the `hocr` output (for example), set the following: `worker.recognize(image, {}, { hocr: true })`\n    - Minor changes to the structure of the JavaScript object (`blocks`) output\n    - See [this issue](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/issues/993) for full list\n\n## Major changes in v5\nVersion 5 changes are documented in [this issue](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/issues/820).  Highlights are below.\n\n - Significantly smaller files by default (54% smaller for English, 73% smaller for Chinese)\n    - This results in a ~50% reduction in runtime for first-time users (who do not have the files cached yet)\n - Significantly lower memory usage\n - Breaking changes:\n    - `createWorker` arguments changed\n       - Setting non-default language and OEM now happens in `createWorker`\n          - E.g. `createWorker("chi_sim", 1)`\n    - `worker.initialize` and `worker.loadLanguage` functions should be deleted from code\n    - See [this issue](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/issues/820) for full list\n\nUpgrading from v2 to v5?  See [this guide](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/issues/771).\n\n## Major changes in v4\nVersion 4 includes many new features and bug fixes--see [this issue](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/issues/662) for a full list.  Several highlights are below. \n\n- Added rotation preprocessing options (including auto-rotate) for significantly better accuracy\n- Processed images (rotated, grayscale, binary) can now be retrieved\n- Improved support for parallel processing (schedulers)\n- Breaking changes:\n  - `createWorker` is now async\n  - `getPDF` function replaced by `pdf` recognize option\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development\nTo run a development copy of Tesseract.js do the following:\n```shell\n# First we clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js.git\ncd tesseract.js\n\n# Then we install the dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# And finally we start the development server\nnpm start\n```\n\nThe development server will be available at http://localhost:3000/examples/browser/basic-efficient.html in your favorite browser.\nIt will automatically rebuild `tesseract.min.js` and `worker.min.js` when you change files in the **src** folder.\n\n### Building Static Files\nTo build the compiled static files just execute the following:\n```shell\nnpm run build\n```\nThis will output the files into the `dist` directory.\n\n### Run Tests\n**Always confirm the automated tests pass before submitting a pull request.**  To run the automated tests locally, run the following commands.\n```shell\nnpm run lint\nnpm run test\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\n### Code Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.

Install Requirements\n#### 1.1 General Setup\n> Follow the original repo to test if you got all environment ready.\n**Python 3.7 or higher ** is needed to run the toolbox.\n\n* Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n> If you get an `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==1.9.0+cu102 (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2 )` This error is probably due to a low version of python, try using 3.9 and it will install successfully\n* Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages).\n* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the remaining necessary packages.\n> The recommended environment here is `Repo Tag 0.0.1` `Pytorch1.9.0 with Torchvision0.10.0 and cudatoolkit10.2` `requirements.txt` `webrtcvad-wheels` because `requirements. txt` was exported a few months ago, so it doesn''t work with newer versions\n* Install webrtcvad `pip install webrtcvad-wheels`(If you need)\n\nor\n- install dependencies with `conda` or `mamba`\n\n  ```conda env create -n env_name -f env.yml```\n\n  ```mamba env create -n env_name -f env.yml```\n\n  will create a virtual environment where necessary dependencies are installed. Switch to the new environment by `conda activate env_name` and enjoy it.\n  > env.yml only includes the necessary dependencies to run the project，temporarily without monotonic-align. You can check the official website to install the GPU version of pytorch.\n\n#### 1.2 Setup with a M1 Mac\n> The following steps are a workaround to directly use the original `demo_toolbox.py`without the changing of codes.\n>\n  >  Since the major issue comes with the PyQt5 packages used in `demo_toolbox.py` not compatible with M1 chips, were one to attempt on training models with the M1 chip, either that person can forgo `demo_toolbox.py`, or one can try the `web.py` in the project.\n\n##### 1.2.1 Install `PyQt5`, with [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68038451/20455983) here.\n  * Create and open a Rosetta Terminal, with [ref](https://dev.to/courier/tips-and-tricks-to-setup-your-apple-m1-for-development-547g) here.\n  * Use system Python to create a virtual environment for the project\n    ```\n    /usr/bin/python3 -m venv /PathToMockingBird/venv\n    source /PathToMockingBird/venv/bin/activate\n    ```\n  * Upgrade pip and install `PyQt5`\n    ```\n    pip install --upgrade pip\n    pip install pyqt5\n    ```\n##### 1.2.2 Install `pyworld` and `ctc-segmentation`\n\n> Both packages seem to be unique to this project and are not seen in the original [Real-Time Voice Cloning](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning) project. When installing with `pip install`, both packages lack wheels so the program tries to directly compile from c code and could not find `Python.h`.\n\n  * Install `pyworld`\n      * `brew install python` `Python.h` can come with Python installed by brew\n      * `export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers` The filepath of brew-installed `Python.h` is unique to M1 MacOS and listed above. One needs to manually add the path to the environment variables.\n      * `pip install pyworld` that should do.\n\n\n  * Install`ctc-segmentation`\n    > Same method does not apply to `ctc-segmentation`, and one needs to compile it from the source code on [github](https://github.com/lumaku/ctc-segmentation).\n    * `git clone https://github.com/lumaku/ctc-segmentation.git`\n    * `cd ctc-segmentation`\n    * `source /PathToMockingBird/venv/bin/activate` If the virtual environment hasn''t been deployed, activate it.\n    * `cythonize -3 ctc_segmentation/ctc_segmentation_dyn.pyx`\n    * `/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 python setup.py build` Build with x86 architecture.\n    * `/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 python setup.py install --optimize=1 --skip-build`Install with x86 architecture.\n\n##### 1.2.3 Other dependencies\n  * `/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 pip install torch torchvision torchaudio` Pip installing `PyTorch` as an example, articulate that it''s installed with x86 architecture\n  * `pip install ffmpeg`  Install ffmpeg\n  * `pip install -r requirements.txt` Install other requirements.\n\n##### 1.2.4 Run the Inference Time (with Toolbox)\n  > To run the project on x86 architecture. [ref](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-46290/Allow-running-Python-under-Rosetta-2-in-PyCharm-for-Apple-Silicon).\n  * `vim /PathToMockingBird/venv/bin/pythonM1` Create an executable file `pythonM1` to condition python interpreter at `/PathToMockingBird/venv/bin`.\n  * Write in the following content:\n    ```\n    #!/usr/bin/env zsh\n    mydir=${0:a:h}\n    /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 $mydir/python "$@"\n    ```\n  * `chmod +x pythonM1` Set the file as executable.\n  * If using PyCharm IDE, configure project interpreter to `pythonM1`([steps here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html#add-existing-interpreter)), if using command line python, run `/PathToMockingBird/venv/bin/pythonM1 demo_toolbox.py`\n\n\n### 2. Prepare your models\n> Note that we are using the pretrained encoder/vocoder but not synthesizer, since the original model is incompatible with the Chinese symbols. It means the demo_cli is not working at this moment, so additional synthesizer models are required.\n\nYou can either train your models or use existing ones:\n\n#### 2.1 Train encoder with your dataset (Optional)\n\n* Preprocess with the audios and the mel spectrograms:\n`python encoder_preprocess.py <datasets_root>` Allowing parameter `--dataset {dataset}` to support the datasets you want to preprocess. Only the train set of these datasets will be used. Possible names: librispeech_other, voxceleb1, voxceleb2. Use comma to sperate multiple datasets.\n\n* Train the encoder: `python encoder_train.py my_run <datasets_root>/SV2TTS/encoder`\n> For training, the encoder uses visdom. You can disable it with `--no_visdom`, but it''s nice to have. Run "visdom" in a separate CLI/process to start your visdom server.\n\n#### 2.2 Train synthesizer with your dataset\n* Download dataset and unzip: make sure you can access all .wav in folder\n* Preprocess with the audios and the mel spectrograms:\n`python pre.py <datasets_root>`\nAllowing parameter `--dataset {dataset}` to support aidatatang_200zh, magicdata, aishell3, data_aishell, etc.If this parameter is not passed, the default dataset will be aidatatang_200zh.\n\n* Train the synthesizer:\n`python train.py --type=synth mandarin <datasets_root>/SV2TTS/synthesizer`\n\n* Go to next step when you see attention line show and loss meet your need in training folder *synthesizer/saved_models/*.\n\n#### 2.3 Use pretrained model of synthesizer\n> Thanks to the community, some models will be shared:\n\n| author | Download link | Preview Video | Info |\n| --- | ----------- | ----- |----- |\n| @author | https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iONvRxmkI-t1nHqxKytY3g  [Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iONvRxmkI-t1nHqxKytY3g) 4j5d  |  | 75k steps trained by multiple datasets\n| @author | https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fMh9IlgKJlL2PIiRTYDUvw  [Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fMh9IlgKJlL2PIiRTYDUvw) code：om7f  |  | 25k steps trained by multiple datasets, only works under version 0.0.1\n|@FawenYo | https://yisiou-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/lawrence_cheng_fawenyo_onmicrosoft_com/EWFWDHzee-NNg9TWdKckCc4BC7bK2j9cCbOWn0-_tK0nOg?e=n0gGgC  | [input](https://github.com/babysor/MockingBird/wiki/audio/self_test.mp3) [output](https://github.com/babysor/MockingBird/wiki/audio/export.wav) | 200k steps with local accent of Taiwan, only works under version 0.0.1\n|@miven| https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PI-hM3sn5wbeChRryX-RCQ code: 2021 https://www.aliyundrive.com/s/AwPsbo8mcSP code: z2m0 | https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uh411B7AD/ | only works under version 0.0.1\n\n#### 2.4 Train vocoder (Optional)\n> note: vocoder has little difference in effect, so you may not need to train a new one.\n* Preprocess the data:\n`python vocoder_preprocess.py <datasets_root> -m <synthesizer_model_path>`\n> `<datasets_root>` replace with your dataset root，`<synthesizer_model_path>`replace with directory of your best trained models of sythensizer, e.g. *sythensizer\saved_mode\xxx*\n\n* Train the wavernn vocoder:\n`python vocoder_train.py mandarin <datasets_root>`\n\n* Train the hifigan vocoder\n`python vocoder_train.py mandarin <datasets_root> hifigan`\n\n### 3.

Whether you''re looking for a simple inference solution or training your own diffusion models, 🤗 Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance), [simple over easy](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability over abstractions](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction).\n\n🤗 Diffusers offers three core components:\n\n- State-of-the-art [diffusion pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/overview) that can be run in inference with just a few lines of code.\n- Interchangeable noise [schedulers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/schedulers/overview) for different diffusion speeds and output quality.\n- Pretrained [models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/models/overview) that can be used as building blocks, and combined with schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nWe recommend installing 🤗 Diffusers in a virtual environment from PyPI or Conda. For more details about installing [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), please refer to their official documentation.\n\n### PyTorch\n\nWith `pip` (official package):\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade diffusers[torch]\n```\n\nWith `conda` (maintained by the community):\n\n```sh\nconda install -c conda-forge diffusers\n```\n\n### Apple Silicon (M1/M2) support\n\nPlease refer to the [How to use Stable Diffusion in Apple Silicon](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) guide.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nGenerating outputs is super easy with 🤗 Diffusers. To generate an image from text, use the `from_pretrained` method to load any pretrained diffusion model (browse the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers&sort=downloads) for 30,000+ checkpoints):\n\n```python\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\nimport torch\n\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\npipeline.to("cuda")\npipeline("An image of a squirrel in Picasso style").images[0]\n```\n\nYou can also dig into the models and schedulers toolbox to build your own diffusion system:\n\n```python\nfrom diffusers import DDPMScheduler, UNet2DModel\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torch\n\nscheduler = DDPMScheduler.from_pretrained("google/ddpm-cat-256")\nmodel = UNet2DModel.from_pretrained("google/ddpm-cat-256").to("cuda")\nscheduler.set_timesteps(50)\n\nsample_size = model.config.sample_size\nnoise = torch.randn((1, 3, sample_size, sample_size), device="cuda")\ninput = noise\n\nfor t in scheduler.timesteps:\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        noisy_residual = model(input, t).sample\n        prev_noisy_sample = scheduler.step(noisy_residual, t, input).prev_sample\n        input = prev_noisy_sample\n\nimage = (input / 2 + 0.5).clamp(0, 1)\nimage = image.cpu().permute(0, 2, 3, 1).numpy()[0]\nimage = Image.fromarray((image * 255).round().astype("uint8"))\nimage\n```\n\nCheck out the [Quickstart](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/quicktour) to launch your diffusion journey today!\n\n## How to navigate the documentation\n\n| **Documentation**                                                   | **What can I learn?**                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [Tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/tutorials/tutorial_overview)                                                            | A basic crash course for learning how to use the library''s most important features like using models and schedulers to build your own diffusion system, and training your own diffusion model.  |\n| [Loading](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/using-diffusers/loading)                                                             | Guides for how to load and configure all the components (pipelines, models, and schedulers) of the library, as well as how to use different schedulers.                                         |\n| [Pipelines for inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/using-diffusers/overview_techniques)                                             | Guides for how to use pipelines for different inference tasks, batched generation, controlling generated outputs and randomness, and how to contribute a pipeline to the library.               |\n| [Optimization](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16)                                                        | Guides for how to optimize your diffusion model to run faster and consume less memory.                                                                                                          |\n| [Training](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/overview) | Guides for how to train a diffusion model for different tasks with different training techniques.                                                                                               |\n## Contribution\n\nWe ❤️  contributions from the open-source community!\nIf you want to contribute to this library, please check out our [Contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\nYou can look out for [issues](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues) you''d like to tackle to contribute to the library.\n- See [Good first issues](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for general opportunities to contribute\n- See [New model/pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+pipeline%2Fmodel%22) to contribute exciting new diffusion models / diffusion pipelines\n- See [New scheduler](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+scheduler%22)\n\nAlso, say 👋 in our public Discord channel <a href="https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR"><img alt="Join us on Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/823813159592001537?color=5865F2&logo=discord&logoColor=white"></a>.

The dataset is CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use) and models trained using the dataset should not be used outside of research purposes. \nThe weight diff is also CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use).\n\n## Overview\n\nThe current Alpaca model is fine-tuned from a 7B LLaMA model [1] on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct [2] paper, with some modifications that we discuss in the next section.\nIn a preliminary human evaluation, we found that the Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the `text-davinci-003` model on the Self-Instruct instruction-following evaluation suite [2].\n\nAlpaca is still under development, and there are many limitations that have to be addressed.\nImportantly, we have not yet fine-tuned the Alpaca model to be safe and harmless.\nWe thus encourage users to be cautious when interacting with Alpaca, and to report any concerning behavior to help improve the safety and ethical considerations of the model.\n\nOur initial release contains the data generation procedure, dataset, and training recipe. We intend to release the model weights if we are given permission to do so by the creators of LLaMA. For now, we have chosen to host a live demo to help readers better understand the capabilities and limits of Alpaca, as well as a way to help us better evaluate Alpaca''s performance on a broader audience.\n\n**Please read our release [blog post](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) for more details about the model, our discussion of the potential harm and limitations of Alpaca models, and our thought process for releasing a reproducible model.**\n\n[1]: LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models.

Each of the 52K instructions is unique.\n- `input`: `str`, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is "Summarize the following article", the input is the article. Around 40% of the examples have an input.\n- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `text-davinci-003`.\n\nWe used the following prompts for fine-tuning the Alpaca model:\n\n- for examples with a non-empty input field:\n\n ```\n Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n \n ### Instruction:\n {instruction}\n \n ### Input:\n {input}\n \n ### Response:\n ```\n\n- for examples with an empty input field:\n\n ```\n Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n \n ### Instruction:\n {instruction}\n \n ### Response:\n ```\n\n During inference (eg for the web demo), we use the user instruction with an empty input field (second option).\n\n## Data Generation Process\n\n<details>\n<summary> <strong> Running the code </strong> </summary>\n\n1. Set environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key.\n2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n3. Run `python -m generate_instruction generate_instruction_following_data` to generate the data.\n\n</details>\n\nWe built on the data generation pipeline from [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct) and made the following modifications:\n\n- We used `text-davinci-003` to generate the instruction data instead of `davinci`.\n- We wrote a new prompt (`prompt.txt`) that explicitly gave the requirement of instruction generation to `text-davinci-003`. Note: there is a slight error in the prompt we used, and future users should incorporate the edit in <https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/pull/24>\n- We adopted much more aggressive batch decoding, i.e., generating 20 instructions at once, which significantly reduced the cost of data generation.\n- We simplified the data generation pipeline by discarding the difference between classification and non-classification instructions.\n- We only generated a single instance for each instruction, instead of 2 to 3 instances as in [1].\n\nThis produced an instruction-following dataset with 52K examples obtained at a much lower cost (less than $500).\nIn a preliminary study, we also find our 52K generated data to be much more diverse than the data released by [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/data/seed_tasks.jsonl).\nWe plot the below figure (in the style of Figure 2 in the [self-instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) to demonstrate the diversity of our data.\nThe inner circle of the plot represents the root verb of the instructions, and the outer circle represents the direct objects.\n\n[//]: # (![parse_analysis]&#40;assert/parse_analysis.png | width=100&#41;)\n[<img src="assets/parse_analysis.png" width="750" />](./assets/parse_analysis.png)\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nWe fine-tune our models using standard Hugging Face training code.\nWe fine-tune LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B with the following hyperparameters:\n\n| Hyperparameter | LLaMA-7B | LLaMA-13B |\n|----------------|----------|-----------|\n| Batch size     | 128      | 128       |\n| Learning rate  | 2e-5     | 1e-5      |\n| Epochs         | 3        | 5         |\n| Max length     | 512      | 512       |\n| Weight decay   | 0        | 0         |\n\nTo reproduce our fine-tuning runs for LLaMA, first install the requirements\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nBelow is a command that fine-tunes LLaMA-7B with our dataset on a machine with 4 A100 80G GPUs in FSDP `full_shard` mode.\nWe were able to reproduce a model of similar quality as the one we hosted in our demo with the following command using **Python 3.10**.\nReplace `<your_random_port>` with a port of your own, `<your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer>` with the\npath to your converted checkpoint and tokenizer (following instructions in the PR), and `<your_output_dir>` with where you want to store your outputs.\n\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \\n    --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \\n    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\n    --bf16 True \\n    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \\n    --num_train_epochs 3 \\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\n    --evaluation_strategy "no" \\n    --save_strategy "steps" \\n    --save_steps 2000 \\n    --save_total_limit 1 \\n    --learning_rate 2e-5 \\n    --weight_decay 0. \\n    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\n    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \\n    --logging_steps 1 \\n    --fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap" \\n    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap ''LlamaDecoderLayer'' \\n    --tf32 True\n```\n\nThe same script also works for OPT fine-tuning. Here''s an example for fine-tuning OPT-6.7B\n\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \\n    --model_name_or_path "facebook/opt-6.7b" \\n    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\n    --bf16 True \\n    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \\n    --num_train_epochs 3 \\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\n    --evaluation_strategy "no" \\n    --save_strategy "steps" \\n    --save_steps 2000 \\n    --save_total_limit 1 \\n    --learning_rate 2e-5 \\n    --weight_decay 0. \\n    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\n    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \\n    --logging_steps 1 \\n    --fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap" \\n    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap ''OPTDecoderLayer'' \\n    --tf32 True\n```\n\nNote the given training script is meant to be simple and easy to use, and is not particularly optimized.\nTo run on more gpus, you may prefer to turn down `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep a global batch size of 128. Global batch size has not been tested for optimality.\n\n### Addressing OOM\n\nNaively, fine-tuning a 7B model requires about 7 x 4 x 4 = 112 GB of VRAM. Commands given above enable parameter sharding, so no redundant model copy is stored on any GPU.\nIf you''d like to further reduce the memory footprint, here are some options:\n\n- Turn on CPU offload for FSDP with `--fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap offload"`. This saves VRAM at the cost of longer runtime.\n- In our experience, DeepSpeed stage-3 (with offload) can at times be more memory efficient than FSDP with offload. Here''s an example to use DeepSpeed stage-3 with 4 GPUs with both parameter and optimizer offload:\n    ```bash\n    pip install deepspeed\n    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \\n        --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \\n        --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\n        --bf16 True \\n        --output_dir <your_output_dir> \\n        --num_train_epochs 3 \\n        --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\n        --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\n        --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\n        --evaluation_strategy "no" \\n        --save_strategy "steps" \\n        --save_steps 2000 \\n        --save_total_limit 1 \\n        --learning_rate 2e-5 \\n        --weight_decay 0. \\n        --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\n        --deepspeed "./configs/default_offload_opt_param.json" \\n        --tf32 True\n    ```\n  - The DeepSpeed library also provides some [helpful functions](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory.html) to estimate memory usage. \n- [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) fine-tunes low-rank slices of the query, key, and value embedding heads. This can reduce the total memory footprint from 112GB to about 7x4=28GB. We may release our re-implemention of this in the future, but for now the [peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) codebase can be a useful resource.\n\n## Recovering Alpaca Weights\n\nThe weight diff between Alpaca-7B and LLaMA-7B is located [here](https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b-wdiff/tree/main).\nTo recover the original Alpaca-7B weights, follow these steps:\n```text\n1. Convert Meta''s released weights into huggingface format. Follow this guide:\n    https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama\n2. Make sure you cloned the released weight diff into your local machine. The weight diff is located at:\n    https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b/tree/main\n3. Run this function with the correct paths. E.g.,\n    python weight_diff.py recover --path_raw <path_to_step_1_dir> --path_diff <path_to_step_2_dir> --path_tuned <path_to_store_recovered_weights>\n```\n\nOnce step 3 completes, you should have a directory with the recovered weights, from which you can load the model like the following\n\n```python\nimport transformers\nalpaca_model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("<path_to_store_recovered_weights>")\nalpaca_tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("<path_to_store_recovered_weights>")\n```\n\n### Authors\n\nAll grad students below contributed equally and the order is determined by random draw.\n\n- [Rohan Taori](https://www.rohantaori.com/)\n- [Ishaan Gulrajani](https://ishaan.io/)\n- [Tianyi Zhang](https://tiiiger.github.io/)\n- [Yann Dubois](https://yanndubs.github.io/)\n- [Xuechen Li](https://www.lxuechen.com/)\n\nAll advised by [Tatsunori B.

Please read [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more details.\n\n## About\n\n**Spleeter** is [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) source separation library with pretrained models\nwritten in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org/). It makes it easy\nto train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides\nalready trained state of the art model for performing various flavour of separation :\n\n* Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation ([2 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-2stems-model))\n* Vocals / drums / bass / other separation ([4 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-4stems-model))\n* Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation ([5 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-5stems-model))\n\n2 stems and 4 stems models have [high performances](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/Separation-Performances) on the [musdb](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html) dataset. **Spleeter** is also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.\n\nWe designed **Spleeter** so you can use it straight from [command line](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#usage)\nas well as directly in your own development pipeline as a [Python library](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/4.-API-Reference#separator). It can be installed with [pip](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-pip) or be used with\n[Docker](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-docker-image).\n\n### Projects and Softwares using **Spleeter**\n\nSince it''s been released, there are multiple forks exposing **Spleeter** through either a Guided User Interface (GUI) or a standalone free or paying website. Please note that we do not host, maintain or directly support any of these initiatives.\n\nThat being said, many cool projects have been built on top of ours. Notably the porting to the *Ableton Live* ecosystem through the [Spleeter 4 Max](https://github.com/diracdeltas/spleeter4max#spleeter-for-max) project.\n\n**Spleeter** pre-trained models have also been used by professionnal audio softwares. Here''s a non-exhaustive list:\n\n* [iZotope](https://www.izotope.com/en/shop/rx-8-standard.html) in its *Music Rebalance* feature within **RX 8**\n* [SpectralLayers](https://new.steinberg.net/spectralayers/) in its *Unmix* feature in **SpectralLayers 7**\n* [Acon Digital](https://acondigital.com/products/acoustica-audio-editor/) within **Acoustica 7**\n* [VirtualDJ](https://www.virtualdj.com/stems/) in their stem isolation feature\n* [Algoriddim](https://www.algoriddim.com/apps) in their **NeuralMix** and **djayPRO** app suite\n\n🆕 **Spleeter** is a baseline in the ongoing [Music Demixing Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/music-demixing-challenge-ismir-2021)!\n\n## Spleeter Pro (Commercial version)\n\nCheck out our commercial version : [Spleeter Pro](https://www.deezer-techservices.com/solutions/spleeter/). Benefit from our expertise for precise audio separation, faster processing speeds, and dedicated professional support. \n\n## Quick start\n\nWant to try it out but don''t want to install anything ? We have set up a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/spleeter.ipynb).\n\nReady to dig into it ? In a few lines you can install **Spleeter**  and separate the vocal and accompaniment parts from an example audio file.\nYou need first to install `ffmpeg` and `libsndfile`. It can be done on most platform using [Conda](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-conda):\n\n```bash\n# install dependencies using conda\nconda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg libsndfile\n# install spleeter with pip\npip install spleeter\n# download an example audio file (if you don''t have wget, use another tool for downloading)\nwget https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/raw/master/audio_example.mp3\n# separate the example audio into two components\nspleeter separate -p spleeter:2stems -o output audio_example.mp3\n```\n\n> :warning: Note that we no longer recommend using `conda` for installing spleeter.\n\n> ⚠️ There are known issues with Apple M1 chips, mostly due to TensorFlow compatibility. Until these are fixed, you can use [this workaround](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/607#issuecomment-1021669444).\n\nYou should get two separated audio files (`vocals.wav` and `accompaniment.wav`) in the `output/audio_example` folder.\n\nFor a detailed documentation, please check the [repository wiki](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation)\n\n## Development and Testing\n\nThis project is managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/), to run test suite you\ncan execute the following set of commands:\n\n```bash\n# Clone spleeter repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter && cd spleeter\n# Install poetry\npip install poetry\n# Install spleeter dependencies\npoetry install\n# Run unit test suite\npoetry run pytest tests/\n```\n\n## Reference\n\n* Deezer Research - Source Separation Engine Story - deezer.io blog post:\n  * [English version](https://deezer.io/releasing-spleeter-deezer-r-d-source-separation-engine-2b88985e797e)\n  * [Japanese version](http://dzr.fm/splitterjp)\n* [Music Source Separation tool with pre-trained models / ISMIR2019 extended abstract](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000036.pdf)\n\nIf you use **Spleeter** in your work, please cite:\n\n```BibTeX\n@article{spleeter2020,\n  doi = {10.21105/joss.02154},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02154},\n  year = {2020},\n  publisher = {The Open Journal},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {50},\n  pages = {2154},\n  author = {Romain Hennequin and Anis Khlif and Felix Voituret and Manuel Moussallam},\n  title = {Spleeter: a fast and efficient music source separation tool with pre-trained models},\n  journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},\n  note = {Deezer Research}\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe code of **Spleeter** is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nIf you plan to use **Spleeter** on copyrighted material, make sure you get proper authorization from right owners beforehand.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Spleeter** is a complex piece of software and although we continously try to improve and test it you may encounter unexpected issues running it. If that''s the case please check the [FAQ page](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/5.-FAQ) first as well as the list of [currently open issues](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues)\n\n### Windows users\n\n   It appears that sometimes the shortcut command `spleeter` does not work properly on windows. This is a known issue that we will hopefully fix soon. In the meantime replace `spleeter separate` by `python -m spleeter separate` in command line and it should work.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to participate in the development of **Spleeter** you are more than welcome to do so.
