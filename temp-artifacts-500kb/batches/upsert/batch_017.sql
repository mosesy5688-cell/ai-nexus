The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.\n\n<!-- END Apache Airflow, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON''T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n**Table of contents**\n\n- [Project Focus](#project-focus)\n- [Principles](#principles)\n- [Requirements](#requirements)\n- [Getting started](#getting-started)\n- [Installing from PyPI](#installing-from-pypi)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Official source code](#official-source-code)\n- [Convenience packages](#convenience-packages)\n- [User Interface](#user-interface)\n- [Semantic versioning](#semantic-versioning)\n- [Version Life Cycle](#version-life-cycle)\n- [Support for Python and Kubernetes versions](#support-for-python-and-kubernetes-versions)\n- [Base OS support for reference Airflow images](#base-os-support-for-reference-airflow-images)\n- [Approach to dependencies of Airflow](#approach-to-dependencies-of-airflow)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Voting Policy](#voting-policy)\n- [Who uses Apache Airflow?](#who-uses-apache-airflow)\n- [Who maintains Apache Airflow?](#who-maintains-apache-airflow)\n- [What goes into the next release?](#what-goes-into-the-next-release)\n- [Can I use the Apache Airflow logo in my presentation?](#can-i-use-the-apache-airflow-logo-in-my-presentation)\n- [Links](#links)\n- [Sponsors](#sponsors)\n\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n\n## Project Focus\n\nAirflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the DAG structure is similar from one run to the next, it clarifies the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/) and [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/).\n\nAirflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow''s [XCom feature](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/xcoms.html)). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work.\n\nAirflow is not a streaming solution, but it is often used to process real-time data, pulling data off streams in batches.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Dynamic**: Pipelines are defined in code, enabling dynamic dag generation and parameterization.\n- **Extensible**: The Airflow framework includes a wide range of built-in operators and can be extended to fit your needs.\n- **Flexible**: Airflow leverages the [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine, allowing rich customizations.\n\n<!-- START Requirements, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n## Requirements\n\nApache Airflow is tested with:\n\n|            | Main version (dev)           | Stable version (3.1.3) |\n|------------|------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Python     | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13       | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 |\n| Platform   | AMD64/ARM64(\*)              | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        |\n| Kubernetes | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33, 1.34 | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 |\n| PostgreSQL | 14, 15, 16, 17, 18           | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     |\n| MySQL      | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation         | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   |\n| SQLite     | 3.15.0+                      | 3.15.0+                |\n\n\* Experimental\n\n**Note**: MariaDB is not tested/recommended.\n\n**Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend\nusing the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.\n\n**Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly\ntested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS.\nOn Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers.\nThe work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388), but\nit is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment\nas this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that\nis used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is\n`Debian Bookworm`.\n\n<!-- END Requirements, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n<!-- START Getting started, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n## Getting started\n\nVisit the official Airflow website documentation (latest **stable** release) for help with\n[installing Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/),\n[getting started](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html), or walking\nthrough a more complete [tutorial](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/).\n\n> Note: If you''re looking for documentation for the main branch (latest development branch): you can find it on [s.apache.org/airflow-docs](https://s.apache.org/airflow-docs/).\n\nFor more information on Airflow Improvement Proposals (AIPs), visit\nthe [Airflow Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals).\n\nDocumentation for dependent projects like provider distributions, Docker image, Helm Chart, you''ll find it in [the documentation index](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/).\n\n<!-- END Getting started, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n<!-- START Installing from PyPI, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n\n## Installing from PyPI\n\nWe publish Apache Airflow as `apache-airflow` package in PyPI. Installing it however might be sometimes tricky\nbecause Airflow is a bit of both a library and application. Libraries usually keep their dependencies open, and\napplications usually pin them, but we should do neither and both simultaneously. We decided to keep\nour dependencies as open as possible (in `pyproject.toml`) so users can install different versions of libraries\nif needed. This means that `pip install apache-airflow` will not work from time to time or will\nproduce unusable Airflow installation.\n\nTo have repeatable installation, however, we keep a set of "known-to-be-working" constraint\nfiles in the orphan `constraints-main` and `constraints-2-0` branches. We keep those "known-to-be-working"\nconstraints files separately per major/minor Python version.\nYou can use them as constraint files when installing Airflow from PyPI. Note that you have to specify\ncorrect Airflow tag/version/branch and Python versions in the URL.\n\n1. Installing just Airflow:\n\n> Note: Only `pip` installation is currently officially supported.\n\nWhile it is possible to install Airflow with tools like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) or\n[pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools), they do not share the same workflow as\n`pip` - especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management.\nInstalling via `Poetry` or `pip-tools` is not currently supported.\n\nIf you wish to install Airflow using those tools, you should use the constraint files and convert\nthem to the appropriate format and workflow that your tool requires.\n\n\n```bash\npip install ''apache-airflow==3.1.3'' \\n --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.1.3/constraints-3.10.txt"\n```\n\n2. Installing with extras (i.e., postgres, google)\n\n```bash\npip install ''apache-airflow[postgres,google]==3.1.3'' \\n --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.1.3/constraints-3.10.txt"\n```\n\nFor information on installing provider distributions, check\n[providers](http://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html).\n\n<!-- END Installing from PyPI, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n\n## Installation\n\nFor comprehensive instructions on setting up your local development environment and installing Apache Airflow, please refer to the [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md) file.\n\n<!-- START Official source code, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n## Official source code\n\nApache Airflow is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org) (ASF) project,\nand our official source code releases:\n\n- Follow the [ASF Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html)\n- Can be downloaded from [the ASF Distribution Directory](https://downloads.apache.org/airflow)\n- Are cryptographically signed by the release manager\n- Are officially voted on by the PMC members during the\n  [Release Approval Process](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval)\n\nFollowing the ASF rules, the source packages released must be sufficient for a user to build and test the\nrelease provided they have access to the appropriate platform and tools.\n\n<!-- END Official source code, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n## Convenience packages\n\nThere are other ways of installing and using Airflow. Those are "convenience" methods - they are\nnot "official releases" as stated by the `ASF Release Policy`, but they can be used by the users\nwho do not want to build the software themselves.\n\nThose are - in the order of most common ways people install Airflow:\n\n- [PyPI releases](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/) to install Airflow using standard `pip` tool\n- [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow) to install airflow via\n  `docker` tool, use them in Kubernetes, Helm Charts, `docker-compose`, `docker swarm`, etc. You can\n  read more about using, customizing, and extending the images in the\n  [Latest docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/index.html), and\n  learn details on the internals in the [images](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/index.html) document.\n- [Tags in GitHub](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tags) to retrieve the git project sources that\n  were used to generate official source packages via git\n\nAll those artifacts are not official releases, but they are prepared using officially released sources.\nSome of those artifacts are "development" or "pre-release" ones, and they are clearly marked as such\nfollowing the ASF Policy.\n\n## User Interface\n\n- **DAGs**: Overview of all DAGs in your environment.\n\n  ![DAGs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/airflow-core/docs/img/ui-dark/dags.png)\n\n- **Assets**: Overview of Assets with dependencies.\n\n  ![Asset Dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/airflow-core/docs/img/ui-dark/assets_graph.png)\n\n- **Grid**: Grid representation of a DAG that spans across time.\n\n  ![Grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/airflow-core/docs/img/ui-dark/grid.png)\n\n- **Graph**: Visualization of a DAG''s dependencies and their current status for a specific run.\n\n  ![Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/airflow-core/docs/img/ui-dark/graph.png)\n\n- **Home**: Summary statistics of your Airflow environment.\n\n  ![Home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/airflow-core/docs/img/ui-dark/home.png)\n\n- **Backfill**: Backfilling a DAG for a specific date range.\n\n  ![Backfill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/airflow-core/docs/img/ui-dark/backfill.png)\n\n- **Code**: Quick way to view source code of a DAG.\n\n  ![Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/airflow-core/docs/img/ui-dark/code.png)\n\n## Semantic versioning\n\nAs of Airflow 2.0.0, we support a strict [SemVer](https://semver.org/) approach for all packages released.\n\nThere are few specific rules that we agreed to that define details of versioning of the different\npackages:\n\n* **Airflow**: SemVer rules apply to core airflow only (excludes any changes to providers).\n  Changing limits for versions of Airflow dependencies is not a breaking change on its own.\n* **Airflow Providers**: SemVer rules apply to changes in the particular provider''s code only.\n  SemVer MAJOR and MINOR versions for the packages are independent of the Airflow version.\n  For example, `google 4.1.0` and `amazon 3.1.1` providers can happily be installed\n  with `Airflow 2.1.2`. If there are limits of cross-dependencies between providers and Airflow packages,\n  they are present in providers as `install_requires` limitations. We aim to keep backwards\n  compatibility of providers with all previously released Airflow 2 versions but\n  there will sometimes be breaking changes that might make some, or all\n  providers, have minimum Airflow version specified.\n* **Airflow Helm Chart**: SemVer rules apply to changes in the chart only. SemVer MAJOR and MINOR\n  versions for the chart are independent of the Airflow version. We aim to keep backwards\n  compatibility of the Helm Chart with all released Airflow 2 versions, but some new features might\n  only work starting from specific Airflow releases. We might however limit the Helm\n  Chart to depend on minimal Airflow version.\n* **Airflow API clients**: Their versioning is independent from Airflow versions. They follow their own\n  SemVer rules for breaking changes and new features - which for example allows to change the way we generate\n  the clients.\n\n## Version Life Cycle\n\nApache Airflow version life cycle:\n\n<!-- This table is automatically updated by prek scripts/ci/prek/supported_versions.py -->\n<!-- Beginning of auto-generated table -->\n\n| Version   | Current Patch/Minor   | State     | First Release   | Limited Maintenance   | EOL/Terminated   |\n|-----------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| 3         | 3.1.3                 | Supported | Apr 22, 2025    | TBD                   | TBD              |\n| 2         | 2.11.0                | Supported | Dec 17, 2020    | Oct 22, 2025          | Apr 22, 2026     |\n| 1.10      | 1.10.15               | EOL       | Aug 27, 2018    | Dec 17, 2020          | June 17, 2021    |\n| 1.9       | 1.9.0                 | EOL       | Jan 03, 2018    | Aug 27, 2018          | Aug 27, 2018     |\n| 1.8       | 1.8.2                 | EOL       | Mar 19, 2017    | Jan 03, 2018          | Jan 03, 2018     |\n| 1.7       | 1.7.1.2               | EOL       | Mar 28, 2016    | Mar 19, 2017          | Mar 19, 2017     |\n\n<!-- End of auto-generated table -->\n\nLimited support versions will be supported with security and critical bug fix only.\nEOL versions will not get any fixes nor support.\nWe always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use.\nWe **highly** recommend upgrading to the latest Airflow major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.\n\n## Support for Python and Kubernetes versions\n\nAs of Airflow 2.0, we agreed to certain rules we follow for Python and Kubernetes support.\nThey are based on the official release schedule of Python and Kubernetes, nicely summarized in the\n[Python Developer''s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) and\n[Kubernetes version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).\n\n1. We drop support for Python and Kubernetes versions when they reach EOL. Except for Kubernetes, a\n   version stays supported by Airflow if two major cloud providers still provide support for it. We drop\n   support for those EOL versions in main right after EOL date, and it is effectively removed when we release\n   the first new MINOR (Or MAJOR if there is no new MINOR version) of Airflow. For example, for Python 3.10 it\n   means that we will drop support in main right after 27.06.2023, and the first MAJOR or MINOR version of\n   Airflow released after will not have it.\n\n2. We support a new version of Python/Kubernetes in main after they are officially released, as soon as we\n   make them work in our CI pipeline (which might not be immediate due to dependencies catching up with\n   new versions of Python mostly) we release new images/support in Airflow based on the working CI setup.\n\n3. This policy is best-effort which means there may be situations where we might terminate support earlier\n   if circumstances require it.\n\n## Base OS support for reference Airflow images\n\nThe Airflow Community provides conveniently packaged container images that are published whenever\nwe publish an Apache Airflow release. Those images contain:\n\n* Base OS with necessary packages to install Airflow (stable Debian OS)\n* Base Python installation in versions supported at the time of release for the MINOR version of\n  Airflow released (so there could be different versions for 2.3 and 2.2 line for example)\n* Libraries required to connect to supported Databases (again the set of databases supported depends\n  on the MINOR version of Airflow)\n* Predefined set of popular providers (for details see the [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/Dockerfile)).\n* Possibility of building your own, custom image where the user can choose their own set of providers\n  and libraries (see [Building the image](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html))\n* In the future Airflow might also support a "slim" version without providers nor database clients installed\n\nThe version of the base OS image is the stable version of Debian. Airflow supports using all currently active\nstable versions - as soon as all Airflow dependencies support building, and we set up the CI pipeline for\nbuilding and testing the OS version. Approximately 6 months before the end-of-regular support of a\nprevious stable version of the OS, Airflow switches the images released to use the latest supported\nversion of the OS.\n\nFor example switch from ``Debian Bullseye`` to ``Debian Bookworm`` has been implemented\nbefore 2.8.0 release in October 2023 and ``Debian Bookworm`` will be the only option supported as of\nAirflow 2.10.0.\n\nUsers will continue to be able to build their images using stable Debian releases until the end of regular\nsupport and building and verifying of the images happens in our CI but no unit tests were executed using\nthis image in the `main` branch.\n\n## Approach to dependencies of Airflow\n\nAirflow has a lot of dependencies - direct and transitive, also Airflow is both - library and application,\ntherefore our policies to dependencies has to include both - stability of installation of application,\nbut also ability to install newer version of dependencies for those users who develop DAGs. We developed\nthe approach where `constraints` are used to make sure airflow can be installed in a repeatable way, while\nwe do not limit our users to upgrade most of the dependencies. As a result we decided not to upper-bound\nversion of Airflow dependencies by default, unless we have good reasons to believe upper-bounding them is\nneeded because of importance of the dependency as well as risk it involves to upgrade specific dependency.\nWe also upper-bound the dependencies that we know cause problems.\n\nThe constraint mechanism of ours takes care about finding and upgrading all the non-upper bound dependencies\nautomatically (providing that all the tests pass). Our `main` build failures will indicate in case there\nare versions of dependencies that break our tests - indicating that we should either upper-bind them or\nthat we should fix our code/tests to account for the upstream changes from those dependencies.\n\nWhenever we upper-bound such a dependency, we should always comment why we are doing it - i.e. we should have\na good reason why dependency is upper-bound. And we should also mention what is the condition to remove the\nbinding.\n\n### Approach for dependencies for Airflow Core\n\nThose dependencies are maintained in ``pyproject.toml``.\n\nThere are few dependencies that we decided are important enough to upper-bound them by default, as they are\nknown to follow predictable versioning scheme, and we know that new versions of those are very likely to\nbring breaking changes. We commit to regularly review and attempt to upgrade to the newer versions of\nthe dependencies as they are released, but this is manual process.\n\nThe important dependencies are:\n\n* `SQLAlchemy`: upper-bound to specific MINOR version (SQLAlchemy is known to remove deprecations and\n   introduce breaking changes especially that support for different Databases varies and changes at\n   various speed)\n* `Alembic`: it is important to handle our migrations in predictable and performant way. It is developed\n   together with SQLAlchemy. Our experience with Alembic is that it very stable in MINOR version\n* `Flask`: We are using Flask as the back-bone of our web UI and API. We know major version of Flask\n   are very likely to introduce breaking changes across those so limiting it to MAJOR version makes sense\n* `werkzeug`: the library is known to cause problems in new versions. It is tightly coupled with Flask\n   libraries, and we should update them together\n* `celery`: Celery is a crucial component of Airflow as it used for CeleryExecutor (and similar). Celery\n   [follows SemVer](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/contributing.html?highlight=semver#versions), so\n   we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also, when we bump the upper version of the library,\n   we should make sure Celery Provider minimum Airflow version is updated.\n* `kubernetes`: Kubernetes is a crucial component of Airflow as it is used for the KubernetesExecutor\n   (and similar). Kubernetes Python library [follows SemVer](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python#compatibility),\n   so we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also, when we bump the upper version of the library,\n   we should make sure Kubernetes Provider minimum Airflow version is updated.\n\n### Approach for dependencies in Airflow Providers and extras\n\nThe main part of the Airflow is the Airflow Core, but the power of Airflow also comes from a number of\nproviders that extend the core functionality and are released separately, even if we keep them (for now)\nin the same monorepo for convenience. You can read more about the providers in the\n[Providers documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html). We also\nhave set of policies implemented for maintaining and releasing community-managed providers as well\nas the approach for community vs. 3rd party providers in the [providers](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/PROVIDERS.rst) document.\n\nThose `extras` and `providers` dependencies are maintained in `provider.yaml` of each provider.\n\nBy default, we should not upper-bound dependencies for providers, however each provider''s maintainer\nmight decide to add additional limits (and justify them with comment).\n\n<!-- START Contributing, please keep comment here to allow auto update of PyPI readme.md -->\n\n## Contributing\n\nWant to help build Apache Airflow?

The answer to this is as usual - it depends on various scenarios. The answer is different for PRs and Issues.\n\nTo add a bit of context, we are following the [Semver](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme as described in\n[Airflow release process](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/release-process.html). More\ndetails are explained in detail in this README under the [Semantic versioning](#semantic-versioning) chapter, but\nin short, we have `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions of Airflow.\n\n* `MAJOR` version is incremented in case of breaking changes\n* `MINOR` version is incremented when there are new features added\n* `PATCH` version is incremented when there are only bug-fixes and doc-only changes\n\nGenerally we release `MINOR` versions of Airflow from a branch that is named after the MINOR version. For example\n`2.7.*` releases are released from `v2-7-stable` branch, `2.8.*` releases are released from `v2-8-stable`\nbranch, etc.\n\n1. Most of the time in our release cycle, when the branch for next `MINOR` branch is not yet created, all\nPRs merged to `main` (unless they get reverted), will find their way to the next `MINOR` release. For example\nif the last release is `2.7.3` and `v2-8-stable` branch is not created yet, the next `MINOR` release\nis `2.8.0` and all PRs merged to main will be released in `2.8.0`. However, some PRs (bug-fixes and\ndoc-only changes) when merged, can be cherry-picked to current `MINOR` branch and released in the\nnext `PATCHLEVEL` release. For example, if `2.8.1` is already released and we are working on `2.9.0dev`,  then\nmarking a PR with `2.8.2` milestone means that it will be cherry-picked to `v2-8-test` branch and\nreleased in `2.8.2rc1`, and eventually in `2.8.2`.\n\n2. When we prepare for the next `MINOR` release, we cut new `v2-*-test` and `v2-*-stable` branch\nand prepare `alpha`, `beta` releases for the next `MINOR` version, the PRs merged to main will still be\nreleased in the next `MINOR` release until `rc` version is cut. This is happening because the `v2-*-test`\nand `v2-*-stable` branches are rebased on top of main when next `beta` and `rc` releases are prepared.\nFor example, when we cut `2.10.0beta1` version, anything merged to main before `2.10.0rc1` is released,\nwill find its way to 2.10.0rc1.\n\n3. Then, once we prepare the first RC candidate for the MINOR release, we stop moving the `v2-*-test` and\n`v2-*-stable` branches and the PRs merged to main will be released in the next `MINOR` release.\nHowever, some PRs (bug-fixes and doc-only changes) when merged, can be cherry-picked to current `MINOR`\nbranch and released in the next `PATCHLEVEL` release - for example when the last released version from `v2-10-stable`\nbranch is `2.10.0rc1`, some of the PRs from main can be marked as `2.10.0` milestone by committers,\nthe release manager will try to cherry-pick them into the release branch.\nIf successful, they will be released in `2.10.0rc2` and subsequently in `2.10.0`. This also applies to\nsubsequent `PATCHLEVEL` versions. When for example `2.10.1` is already released, marking a PR with\n`2.10.2` milestone will mean that it will be cherry-picked to `v2-10-stable` branch and released in `2.10.2rc1`\nand eventually in `2.10.2`.\n\nThe final decision about cherry-picking is made by the release manager.\n\nMarking issues with a milestone is a bit different. Maintainers do not mark issues with a milestone usually,\nnormally they are only marked in PRs. If PR linked to the issue (and "fixing it") gets merged and released\nin a specific version following the process described above, the issue will be automatically closed, no\nmilestone will be set for the issue, you need to check the PR that fixed the issue to see which version\nit was released in.\n\nHowever, sometimes maintainers mark issues with specific milestone, which means that the\nissue is important to become a candidate to take a look when the release is being prepared. Since this is an\nOpen-Source project, where basically all contributors volunteer their time, there is no guarantee that specific\nissue will be fixed in specific version. We do not want to hold the release because some issue is not fixed,\nso in such case release manager will reassign such unfixed issues to the next milestone in case they are not\nfixed in time for the current release. Therefore, the milestone for issue is more of an intent that it should be\nlooked at, than promise it will be fixed in the version.\n\nMore context and **FAQ** about the patchlevel release can be found in the\n[What goes into the next release](dev/WHAT_GOES_INTO_THE_NEXT_RELEASE.md) document in the `dev` folder of the\nrepository.\n\n## Can I use the Apache Airflow logo in my presentation?\n\nYes!

quickest way to get started with DeepSpeed is via pip, this will install\nthe latest release of DeepSpeed which is not tied to specific PyTorch or CUDA\nversions. DeepSpeed includes several C++/CUDA extensions that we commonly refer\nto as our ''ops''.  By default, all of these extensions/ops will be built\njust-in-time (JIT) using [torch''s JIT C++ extension loader that relies on\nninja](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cpp_extension.html) to build and\ndynamically link them at runtime.\n\n## Requirements\n* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) must be installed _before_ installing DeepSpeed.\n* For full feature support we recommend a version of PyTorch that is >= 1.9 and ideally the latest PyTorch stable release.\n* A CUDA or ROCm compiler such as [nvcc](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/#introduction) or [hipcc](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIPCC) used to compile C++/CUDA/HIP extensions.\n* Specific GPUs we develop and test against are listed below, this doesn''t mean your GPU will not work if it doesn''t fall into this category it''s just DeepSpeed is most well tested on the following:\n  * NVIDIA: Pascal, Volta, Ampere, and Hopper architectures\n  * AMD: MI100 and MI200\n\n## Contributed HW support\n* DeepSpeed now support various HW accelerators.\n\n| Contributor | Hardware                            | Accelerator Name | Contributor validated | Upstream validated |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------|------------------| --------------------- |--------------------|\n| Huawei      | Huawei Ascend NPU                   | npu              | Yes | No                 |\n| Intel       | Intel(R) Gaudi(R) 2 AI accelerator  | hpu              | Yes | Yes                |\n| Intel       | Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processors         | cpu              | Yes | Yes                |\n| Intel       | Intel(R) Data Center GPU Max series | xpu              | Yes | Yes                |\n| Tecorigin   | Scalable Data Analytics Accelerator | sdaa             | Yes | No                 |\n\n## PyPI\nWe regularly push releases to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/deepspeed/) and encourage users to install from there in most cases.\n\n```bash\npip install deepspeed\n```\n\nAfter installation, you can validate your install and see which extensions/ops\nyour machine is compatible with via the DeepSpeed environment report.\n\n```bash\nds_report\n```\n\nIf you would like to pre-install any of the DeepSpeed extensions/ops (instead\nof JIT compiling) or install pre-compiled ops via PyPI please see our [advanced\ninstallation instructions](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/advanced-install/).\n\n## Windows\nMany DeepSpeed features are supported on Windows for both training and inference. You can read more about this in the original blog post [here](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeed/tree/master/blogs/windows/08-2024/README.md). Among features that are currently not supported are async io (AIO) and GDS (which does not support Windows).\n1. Install PyTorch, such as pytorch 2.3+cu121.\n2.

You can then **share** a link to your demo or web application in just a few seconds using Gradio''s built-in sharing features. *No JavaScript, CSS, or web hosting experience needed!*\n\n<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/gradio-guides/gif-version.gif" style="padding-bottom: 10px">\n\nIt just takes a few lines of Python to create your own demo, so let''s get started 💫\n\n\n### Installation\n\n**Prerequisite**: Gradio requires [Python 3.10 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n\nWe recommend installing Gradio using `pip`, which is included by default in Python. Run this in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade gradio\n```\n\n\n> [!TIP]\n > It is best to install Gradio in a virtual environment. Detailed installation instructions for all common operating systems <a href="https://www.gradio.app/main/guides/installing-gradio-in-a-virtual-environment">are provided here</a>. \n\n### Building Your First Demo\n\nYou can run Gradio in your favorite code editor, Jupyter notebook, Google Colab, or anywhere else you write Python. Let''s write your first Gradio app:\n\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name, intensity):\n    return "Hello, " + name + "!" * int(intensity)\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=greet,\n    inputs=["text", "slider"],\n    outputs=["text"],\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n\n\n> [!TIP]\n > We shorten the imported name from <code>gradio</code> to <code>gr</code>. This is a widely adopted convention for better readability of code. \n\nNow, run your code. If you''ve written the Python code in a file named `app.py`, then you would run `python app.py` from the terminal.\n\nThe demo below will open in a browser on [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860) if running from a file. If you are running within a notebook, the demo will appear embedded within the notebook.\n\n![`hello_world_4` demo](demo/hello_world_4/screenshot.gif)\n\nType your name in the textbox on the left, drag the slider, and then press the Submit button. You should see a friendly greeting on the right.\n\n> [!TIP]\n > When developing locally, you can run your Gradio app in <strong>hot reload mode</strong>, which automatically reloads the Gradio app whenever you make changes to the file. To do this, simply type in <code>gradio</code> before the name of the file instead of <code>python</code>. In the example above, you would type: `gradio app.py` in your terminal. You can also enable <strong>vibe mode</strong> by using the <code>--vibe</code> flag, e.g. <code>gradio --vibe app.py</code>, which provides an in-browser chat that can be used to write or edit your Gradio app using natural language. Learn more in the <a href="https://www.gradio.app/guides/developing-faster-with-reload-mode">Hot Reloading Guide</a>.\n\n\n**Understanding the `Interface` Class**\n\nYou''ll notice that in order to make your first demo, you created an instance of the `gr.Interface` class. The `Interface` class is designed to create demos for machine learning models which accept one or more inputs, and return one or more outputs. \n\nThe `Interface` class has three core arguments:\n\n- `fn`: the function to wrap a user interface (UI) around\n- `inputs`: the Gradio component(s) to use for the input. The number of components should match the number of arguments in your function.\n- `outputs`: the Gradio component(s) to use for the output. The number of components should match the number of return values from your function.\n\nThe `fn` argument is very flexible -- you can pass *any* Python function that you want to wrap with a UI. In the example above, we saw a relatively simple function, but the function could be anything from a music generator to a tax calculator to the prediction function of a pretrained machine learning model.\n\nThe `inputs` and `outputs` arguments take one or more Gradio components. As we''ll see, Gradio includes more than [30 built-in components](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/introduction) (such as the `gr.Textbox()`, `gr.Image()`, and `gr.HTML()` components) that are designed for machine learning applications. \n\n> [!TIP]\n > For the `inputs` and `outputs` arguments, you can pass in the name of these components as a string (`"textbox"`) or an instance of the class (`gr.Textbox()`).\n\nIf your function accepts more than one argument, as is the case above, pass a list of input components to `inputs`, with each input component corresponding to one of the arguments of the function, in order. The same holds true if your function returns more than one value: simply pass in a list of components to `outputs`. This flexibility makes the `Interface` class a very powerful way to create demos.\n\nWe''ll dive deeper into the `gr.Interface` on our series on [building Interfaces](https://www.gradio.app/main/guides/the-interface-class).\n\n### Sharing Your Demo\n\nWhat good is a beautiful demo if you can''t share it? Gradio lets you easily share a machine learning demo without having to worry about the hassle of hosting on a web server. Simply set `share=True` in `launch()`, and a publicly accessible URL will be created for your demo. Let''s revisit our example demo,  but change the last line as follows:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name):\n    return "Hello " + name + "!"\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="textbox", outputs="textbox")\n    \ndemo.launch(share=True)  # Share your demo with just 1 extra parameter 🚀\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, a public URL will be generated for your demo in a matter of seconds, something like:\n\n👉 &nbsp; `https://a23dsf231adb.gradio.live`\n\nNow, anyone around the world can try your Gradio demo from their browser, while the machine learning model and all computation continues to run locally on your computer.\n\nTo learn more about sharing your demo, read our dedicated guide on [sharing your Gradio application](https://www.gradio.app/guides/sharing-your-app).\n\n\n### An Overview of Gradio\n\nSo far, we''ve been discussing the `Interface` class, which is a high-level class that lets you build demos quickly with Gradio. But what else does Gradio include?\n\n#### Custom Demos with `gr.Blocks`\n\nGradio offers a low-level approach for designing web apps with more customizable layouts and data flows with the `gr.Blocks` class. Blocks supports things like controlling where components appear on the page, handling multiple data flows and more complex interactions (e.g. outputs can serve as inputs to other functions), and updating properties/visibility of components based on user interaction — still all in Python. \n\nYou can build very custom and complex applications using `gr.Blocks()`. For example, the popular image generation [Automatic1111 Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is built using Gradio Blocks. We dive deeper into the `gr.Blocks` on our series on [building with Blocks](https://www.gradio.app/guides/blocks-and-event-listeners).\n\n#### Chatbots with `gr.ChatInterface`\n\nGradio includes another high-level class, `gr.ChatInterface`, which is specifically designed to create Chatbot UIs. Similar to `Interface`, you supply a function and Gradio creates a fully working Chatbot UI. If you''re interested in creating a chatbot, you can jump straight to [our dedicated guide on `gr.ChatInterface`](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast).\n\n#### The Gradio Python & JavaScript Ecosystem\n\nThat''s the gist of the core `gradio` Python library, but Gradio is actually so much more! It''s an entire ecosystem of Python and JavaScript libraries that let you build machine learning applications, or query them programmatically, in Python or JavaScript. Here are other related parts of the Gradio ecosystem:\n\n* [Gradio Python Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client) (`gradio_client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in Python.\n* [Gradio JavaScript Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-js-client) (`@gradio/client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in JavaScript.\n* [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces): the most popular place to host Gradio applications — for free!\n\n### What''s Next?\n\nKeep learning about Gradio sequentially using the Gradio Guides, which include explanations as well as example code and embedded interactive demos. Next up: [let''s dive deeper into the Interface class](https://www.gradio.app/guides/the-interface-class).\n\nOr, if you already know the basics and are looking for something specific, you can search the more [technical API documentation](https://www.gradio.app/docs/).\n\n\n### Gradio Sketch\n\nYou can also build Gradio applications without writing any code. Simply type `gradio sketch` into your terminal to open up an editor that lets you define and modify Gradio components, adjust their layouts, add events, all through a web editor. Or [use this hosted version of Gradio Sketch, running on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/aliabid94/Sketch).\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf you''d like to report a bug or have a feature request, please create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/new/choose).

As convenient as they are, single-node development environments such as your laptop cannot scale to meet these demands.\n\nRay is a unified way to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a cluster.\n\nWith Ray, you can seamlessly scale the same code from a laptop to a cluster. Ray is designed to be general-purpose, meaning that it can performantly run any kind of workload. If your application is written in Python, you can scale it with Ray, no other infrastructure required.\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\n- `Documentation`_\n- `Ray Architecture whitepaper`_\n- `Exoshuffle: large-scale data shuffle in Ray`_\n- `Ownership: a distributed futures system for fine-grained tasks`_\n- `RLlib paper`_\n- `Tune paper`_\n\n*Older documents:*\n\n- `Ray paper`_\n- `Ray HotOS paper`_\n- `Ray Architecture v1 whitepaper`_\n\n.. _`Ray AI Libraries`: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-air/getting-started.html\n.. _`Ray Core`: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html\n.. _`Tasks`: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks.html\n.. _`Actors`: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors.html\n.. _`Objects`: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/objects.html\n.. _`Documentation`: http://docs.ray.io/en/latest/index.html\n.. _`Ray Architecture v1 whitepaper`: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lAy0Owi-vPz2jEqBSaHNQcy2IBSDEHyXNOQZlGuj93c/preview\n.. _`Ray Architecture whitepaper`: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBw9A4j62ruI5omIJbMxly-la5w4q_TjyJgJL_jN2fI/preview\n.. _`Exoshuffle: large-scale data shuffle in Ray`: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05072\n.. _`Ownership: a distributed futures system for fine-grained tasks`: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi21-wang.pdf\n.. _`Ray paper`: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05889\n.. _`Ray HotOS paper`: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03924\n.. _`RLlib paper`: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09381\n.. _`Tune paper`: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05118\n\nGetting Involved\n----------------\n\n.. list-table::\n   :widths: 25 50 25 25\n   :header-rows: 1\n\n   * - Platform\n     - Purpose\n     - Estimated Response Time\n     - Support Level\n   * - `Discourse Forum`_\n     - For discussions about development and questions about usage.\n     - < 1 day\n     - Community\n   * - `GitHub Issues`_\n     - For reporting bugs and filing feature requests.\n     - < 2 days\n     - Ray OSS Team\n   * - `Slack`_\n     - For collaborating with other Ray users.\n     - < 2 days\n     - Community\n   * - `StackOverflow`_\n     - For asking questions about how to use Ray.\n     - 3-5 days\n     - Community\n   * - `Meetup Group`_\n     - For learning about Ray projects and best practices.\n     - Monthly\n     - Ray DevRel\n   * - `Twitter`_\n     - For staying up-to-date on new features.\n     - Daily\n     - Ray DevRel\n\n.. _`Discourse Forum`: https://discuss.ray.io/\n.. _`GitHub Issues`: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues\n.. _`StackOverflow`: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ray\n.. _`Meetup Group`: https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Ray-Meetup/\n.. _`Twitter`: https://x.com/raydistributed\n.. _`Slack`: https://www.ray.io/join-slack?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ray_readme&utm_campaign=getting_involved\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":40208,"forks":6980,"watchers":40208,"open_issues":3218,"topics":["data-science","deep-learning","deployment","distributed","hyperparameter-optimization","hyperparameter-search","large-language-models","llm","llm-inference","llm-serving","machine-learning","optimization","parallel","python","pytorch","ray","reinforcement-learning","rllib","serving","tensorflow"],"default_branch":"master","size_kb":643105,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ray-project:ray","source_url":"https://github.com/ray-project/ray"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ray-project:ray","source_url":"https://github.com/ray-project/ray"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:ray-project:ray","source_url":"https://github.com/ray-project/ray"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 65, '4e810944c5ced749b319403d13f5b309', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

You are invited to give ideas you like a thumbs-up, so we know what''s most popular.\n\nBe aware that we have a zero-bug policy and do our best to help users when they need support or have other questions. This comes at a price though, as we can''t give exact release dates for new features. Our team receives many more requests than can be implemented, so we want to emphasize that we are in no way obligated to implement the features, enhancements, or other changes you request. We do, however, appreciate your feedback and carefully consider all requests.\n\n**Because sustained funding is key to quickly releasing new features, we encourage you to support our mission by [signing up for a personal membership](https://link.photoprism.app/membership) or [purchasing a commercial license](https://www.photoprism.app/teams#compare).**\n\n[Become a Member ›](https://link.photoprism.app/membership)\n\n## GitHub Issues ⚠️ ##\n\nWe kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in the app. Thank you for your careful consideration!\n\n- When browsing issues, please note that **our team and all issue subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for [discussions, questions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions), or [expressing personal opinions](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct)\n- In order for us to investigate [new bug reports](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs), they must include **a complete list of steps to reproduce the problem**, the software versions used and information about the environment in which the problem occurred, such as [browser type, browser version, browser plug-ins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [processor type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu), and [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory)\n- [Contact us](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works\n- This gives us the opportunity to [improve our documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support instead of dealing with unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by replying to comments\n\n## Connect with the Community ##\n\n<a href="https://link.photoprism.app/chat"><img align="right" width="144" height="144" src="https://dl.photoprism.app/img/brands/element-logo.svg"></a>\n\nFollow us on [Mastodon](https://floss.social/@photoprism), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/photoprism.app), or join the [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat) to get regular updates, connect with other users, and discuss your ideas. Our [Code of Conduct](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct) explains the "dos and don’ts" when interacting with other community members.\n\nAs a [contributor](CONTRIBUTING.md), you are also welcome to [contact us directly](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) if you have something on your mind that you don''t want to discuss publicly. Please note, however, that due to the high volume of emails we receive, our team may be unable to get back to you immediately.

In the same way that stable-diffusion helped the world make art and\nimages in new ways we hope Open Assistant can help improve the world by\nimproving language itself.\n\n# Useful Links\n\n- [Data Collection](https://open-assistant.io)\n\n- [Chat](https://open-assistant.io/chat)\n\n- [Project Documentation](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/)\n\n## How To Try It Out\n\n### Chatting with the AI\n\nThe chat frontend is now live [here](https://open-assistant.io/chat). Log in and\nstart chatting! Please try to react with a thumbs up or down for the assistant''s\nresponses when chatting.\n\n### Contributing to Data Collection\n\nThe data collection frontend is now live [here](https://open-assistant.io/). Log\nin and start taking on tasks! We want to collect a high volume of quality data.\nBy submitting, ranking, and labelling model prompts and responses you will be\ndirectly helping to improve the capabilities of Open Assistant.\n\n### Running the Development Setup Locally (without chat)\n\n**You do not need to run the project locally unless you are contributing to the\ndevelopment process. The website link above will take you to the public website\nwhere you can use the data collection app and the chat.**\n\nIf you would like to run the data collection app locally for development, you\ncan set up an entire stack needed to run **Open-Assistant**, including the\nwebsite, backend, and associated dependent services, with Docker.\n\nTo start the demo, run this in the root directory of the repository (check\n[this FAQ](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/docs/faq#docker-compose-instead-of-docker-compose)\nif you have problems):\n\n```sh\ndocker compose --profile ci up --build --attach-dependencies\n```\n\n> **Note:** when running on MacOS with an M1 chip you have to use:\n> `DB_PLATFORM=linux/x86_64 docker compose ...`\n\nThen, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (It may take some time to boot up) and\ninteract with the website.\n\n> **Note:** If an issue occurs with the build, please head to the\n> [FAQ](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/docs/faq) and check out the\n> entries about Docker.\n\n> **Note:** When logging in via email, navigate to `http://localhost:1080` to\n> get the magic email login link.\n\n> **Note:** If you would like to run this in a standardized development\n> environment (a\n> ["devcontainer"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers))\n> using\n> [vscode locally](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_create-a-devcontainerjson-file)\n> or in a web browser using\n> [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), you can use the\n> provided [`.devcontainer`](.devcontainer/) folder.\n\n### Running the Development Setup Locally for Chat\n\n**You do not need to run the project locally unless you are contributing to the\ndevelopment process. The website link above will take you to the public website\nwhere you can use the data collection app and the chat.**\n\n**Also note that the local setup is only for development and is not meant to be\nused as a local chatbot, unless you know what you are doing.**\n\nIf you _do_ know what you are doing, then see the `inference` folder for getting\nthe inference system up and running, or have a look at `--profile inference` in\naddition to `--profile ci` in the above command.\n\n## The Vision\n\nWe are not going to stop at replicating ChatGPT. We want to build the assistant\nof the future, able to not only write email and cover letters, but do meaningful\nwork, use APIs, dynamically research information, and much more, with the\nability to be personalized and extended by anyone. And we want to do this in a\nway that is open and accessible, which means we must not only build a great\nassistant, but also make it small and efficient enough to run on consumer\nhardware.\n\n## The Plan\n\n##### We want to get to an initial MVP as fast as possible, by following the 3-steps outlined in the [InstructGPT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155)\n\n1. Collect high-quality human generated Instruction-Fulfillment samples\n   (prompt + response), goal >50k. We design a crowdsourced process to collect\n   and reviewed prompts. We do not want to train on\n   flooding/toxic/spam/junk/personal information data. We will have a\n   leaderboard to motivate the community that shows progress and the most active\n   users. Swag will be given to the top-contributors.\n2. For each of the collected prompts we will sample multiple completions.\n   Completions of one prompt will then be shown randomly to users to rank them\n   from best to worst. Again this should happen crowd-sourced, e.g. we need to\n   deal with unreliable potentially malicious users. At least multiple votes by\n   independent users have to be collected to measure the overall agreement. The\n   gathered ranking-data will be used to train a reward model.\n3. Now follows the RLHF training phase based on the prompts and the reward\n   model.\n\nWe can then take the resulting model and continue with completion sampling step\n2 for a next iteration.\n\n### Slide Decks\n\n[Vision & Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n7IrAOVOqwdYgiYrXc8Sj0He8krn5MVZO_iLkCjTtu0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Important Data Structures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iaX_nxasVWlvPiSNs0cllR9L_1neZq0RJxd6MFEalUY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## How You Can Help\n\nAll open source projects begin with people like you. Open source is the belief\nthat if we collaborate we can together gift our knowledge and technology to the\nworld for the benefit of humanity.\n\nCheck out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n', '{"language":"Python","stars":37497,"forks":3300,"watchers":37497,"open_issues":291,"topics":["ai","assistant","chatgpt","discord-bot","language-model","machine-learning","nextjs","python","rlhf"],"default_branch":"main","size_kb":35477,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":true}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:LAION-AI:Open-Assistant","source_url":"https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:features:codespaces","source_url":"https://github.com/features/codespaces"}]', NULL, 'Apache-2.0', 'approved', 65, '088d2fba3d79519bdbd83d25cd9b1a78', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

You can count on us! 🤝\n\n## 💻 install\n\nPip install the supervision package in a\n[**Python>=3.9**](https://www.python.org/) environment.\n\n```bash\npip install supervision\n```\n\nRead more about conda, mamba, and installing from source in our [guide](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/).\n\n## 🔥 quickstart\n\n### models\n\nSupervision was designed to be model agnostic. Just plug in any classification, detection, or segmentation model. For your convenience, we have created [connectors](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/core/#detections) for the most popular libraries like Ultralytics, Transformers, or MMDetection.\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport supervision as sv\nfrom ultralytics import YOLO\n\nimage = cv2.imread(...)\nmodel = YOLO("yolov8s.pt")\nresult = model(image)[0]\ndetections = sv.Detections.from_ultralytics(result)\n\nlen(detections)\n# 5\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>👉 more model connectors</summary>\n\n- inference\n\n  Running with [Inference](https://github.com/roboflow/inference) requires a [Roboflow API KEY](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key).\n\n  ```python\n  import cv2\n  import supervision as sv\n  from inference import get_model\n\n  image = cv2.imread(...)\n  model = get_model(model_id="yolov8s-640", api_key=<ROBOFLOW API KEY>)\n  result = model.infer(image)[0]\n  detections = sv.Detections.from_inference(result)\n\n  len(detections)\n  # 5\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n### annotators\n\nSupervision offers a wide range of highly customizable [annotators](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/annotators/), allowing you to compose the perfect visualization for your use case.\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport supervision as sv\n\nimage = cv2.imread(...)\ndetections = sv.Detections(...)\n\nbox_annotator = sv.BoxAnnotator()\nannotated_frame = box_annotator.annotate(\n  scene=image.copy(),\n  detections=detections)\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/roboflow/supervision/assets/26109316/691e219c-0565-4403-9218-ab5644f39bce\n\n### datasets\n\nSupervision provides a set of [utils](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/datasets/core/) that allow you to load, split, merge, and save datasets in one of the supported formats.\n\n```python\nimport supervision as sv\nfrom roboflow import Roboflow\n\nproject = Roboflow().workspace(<WORKSPACE_ID>).project(<PROJECT_ID>)\ndataset = project.version(<PROJECT_VERSION>).download("coco")\n\nds = sv.DetectionDataset.from_coco(\n    images_directory_path=f"{dataset.location}/train",\n    annotations_path=f"{dataset.location}/train/_annotations.coco.json",\n)\n\npath, image, annotation = ds[0]\n    # loads image on demand\n\nfor path, image, annotation in ds:\n    # loads image on demand\n```\n\n<details close>\n<summary>👉 more dataset utils</summary>\n\n- load\n\n  ```python\n  dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(\n      images_directory_path=...,\n      annotations_directory_path=...,\n      data_yaml_path=...\n  )\n\n  dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_pascal_voc(\n      images_directory_path=...,\n      annotations_directory_path=...\n  )\n\n  dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_coco(\n      images_directory_path=...,\n      annotations_path=...\n  )\n  ```\n\n- split\n\n  ```python\n  train_dataset, test_dataset = dataset.split(split_ratio=0.7)\n  test_dataset, valid_dataset = test_dataset.split(split_ratio=0.5)\n\n  len(train_dataset), len(test_dataset), len(valid_dataset)\n  # (700, 150, 150)\n  ```\n\n- merge\n\n  ```python\n  ds_1 = sv.DetectionDataset(...)\n  len(ds_1)\n  # 100\n  ds_1.classes\n  # [''dog'', ''person'']\n\n  ds_2 = sv.DetectionDataset(...)\n  len(ds_2)\n  # 200\n  ds_2.classes\n  # [''cat'']\n\n  ds_merged = sv.DetectionDataset.merge([ds_1, ds_2])\n  len(ds_merged)\n  # 300\n  ds_merged.classes\n  # [''cat'', ''dog'', ''person'']\n  ```\n\n- save\n\n  ```python\n  dataset.as_yolo(\n      images_directory_path=...,\n      annotations_directory_path=...,\n      data_yaml_path=...\n  )\n\n  dataset.as_pascal_voc(\n      images_directory_path=...,\n      annotations_directory_path=...\n  )\n\n  dataset.as_coco(\n      images_directory_path=...,\n      annotations_path=...\n  )\n  ```\n\n- convert\n\n  ```python\n  sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(\n      images_directory_path=...,\n      annotations_directory_path=...,\n      data_yaml_path=...\n  ).as_pascal_voc(\n      images_directory_path=...,\n      annotations_directory_path=...\n  )\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n## 🎬 tutorials\n\nWant to learn how to use Supervision?

The files in the [`/docker/compose` directory](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/tree/main/docker/compose) are configured to pull the image from the GitHub container registry.\n\nIf you''d like to jump right in, you can configure a `docker compose` environment with our install script:\n\n```bash\nbash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/main/install-paperless-ngx.sh)"\n```\n\nMore details and step-by-step guides for alternative installation methods can be found in [the documentation](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/setup/#installation).\n\nMigrating from Paperless-ng is easy, just drop in the new docker image! See the [documentation on migrating](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/setup/#migrating-to-paperless-ngx) for more details.\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe documentation for Paperless-ngx is available at [https://docs.paperless-ngx.com](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/).\n\n# Contributing\n\nIf you feel like contributing to the project, please do! Bug fixes, enhancements, visual fixes etc. are always welcome. If you want to implement something big: Please start a discussion about that! The [documentation](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/development/) has some basic information on how to get started.\n\n## Community Support\n\nPeople interested in continuing the work on paperless-ngx are encouraged to reach out here on github and in the [Matrix Room](https://matrix.to/#/#paperless:matrix.org). If you would like to contribute to the project on an ongoing basis there are multiple [teams](https://github.com/orgs/paperless-ngx/people) (frontend, ci/cd, etc) that could use your help so please reach out!\n\n## Translation\n\nPaperless-ngx is available in many languages that are coordinated on Crowdin. If you want to help out by translating paperless-ngx into your language, please head over to https://crowdin.com/project/paperless-ngx, and thank you!

Qlib supports diverse machine learning modeling paradigms, including supervised learning, market dynamics modeling, and reinforcement learning.\n\nAn increasing number of SOTA Quant research works/papers in diverse paradigms are being released in Qlib to collaboratively solve key challenges in quantitative investment. For example, 1) using supervised learning to mine the market''s complex non-linear patterns from rich and heterogeneous financial data, 2) modeling the dynamic nature of the financial market using adaptive concept drift technology, and 3) using reinforcement learning to model continuous investment decisions and assist investors in optimizing their trading strategies.\n\nIt contains the full ML pipeline of data processing, model training, back-testing; and covers the entire chain of quantitative investment: alpha seeking, risk modeling, portfolio optimization, and order execution. \nFor more details, please refer to our paper ["Qlib: An AI-oriented Quantitative Investment Platform"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11189).\n\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Frameworks, Tutorial, Data & DevOps</th>\n      <th>Main Challenges & Solutions in Quant Research</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <li><a href="#plans"><strong>Plans</strong></a></li>\n        <li><a href="#framework-of-qlib">Framework of Qlib</a></li>\n        <li><a href="#quick-start">Quick Start</a></li>\n          <ul dir="auto">\n            <li type="circle"><a href="#installation">Installation</a> </li>\n            <li type="circle"><a href="#data-preparation">Data Preparation</a></li>\n            <li type="circle"><a href="#auto-quant-research-workflow">Auto Quant Research Workflow</a></li>\n            <li type="circle"><a href="#building-customized-quant-research-workflow-by-code">Building Customized Quant Research Workflow by Code</a></li></ul>\n        <li><a href="#quant-dataset-zoo"><strong>Quant Dataset Zoo</strong></a></li>\n        <li><a href="#learning-framework">Learning Framework</a></li>\n        <li><a href="#more-about-qlib">More About Qlib</a></li>\n        <li><a href="#offline-mode-and-online-mode">Offline Mode and Online Mode</a>\n        <ul>\n          <li type="circle"><a href="#performance-of-qlib-data-server">Performance of Qlib Data Server</a></li></ul>\n        <li><a href="#related-reports">Related Reports</a></li>\n        <li><a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a></li>\n        <li><a href="#contributing">Contributing</a></li>\n      </td>\n      <td valign="baseline">\n        <li><a href="#main-challenges--solutions-in-quant-research">Main Challenges &amp; Solutions in Quant Research</a>\n          <ul>\n            <li type="circle"><a href="#forecasting-finding-valuable-signalspatterns">Forecasting: Finding Valuable Signals/Patterns</a>\n              <ul>\n                <li type="disc"><a href="#quant-model-paper-zoo"><strong>Quant Model (Paper) Zoo</strong></a>\n                  <ul>\n                    <li type="circle"><a href="#run-a-single-model">Run a Single Model</a></li>\n                    <li type="circle"><a href="#run-multiple-models">Run Multiple Models</a></li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </li>\n          <li type="circle"><a href="#adapting-to-market-dynamics">Adapting to Market Dynamics</a></li>\n          <li type="circle"><a href="#reinforcement-learning-modeling-continuous-decisions">Reinforcement Learning: modeling continuous decisions</a></li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n# Plans\nNew features under development(order by estimated release time).\nYour feedbacks about the features are very important.\n<!-- | Feature                        | Status      | -->\n<!-- | --                      | ------    | -->\n\n# Framework of Qlib\n\n<div style="align: center">\n<img src="docs/_static/img/framework-abstract.jpg" />\n</div>\n\nThe high-level framework of Qlib can be found above(users can find the [detailed framework](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/introduction.html#framework) of Qlib''s design when getting into nitty gritty).\nThe components are designed as loose-coupled modules, and each component could be used stand-alone.\n\nQlib provides a strong infrastructure to support Quant research. [Data](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html) is always an important part.\nA strong learning framework is designed to support diverse learning paradigms (e.g. [reinforcement learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html), [supervised learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html#model-section)) and patterns at different levels(e.g. [market dynamic modeling](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/meta.html)).\nBy modeling the market, [trading strategies](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/strategy.html) will generate trade decisions that will be executed. Multiple trading strategies and executors in different levels or granularities can be [nested to be optimized and run together](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/highfreq.html).\nAt last, a comprehensive [analysis](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/report.html) will be provided and the model can be [served online](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/online.html) in a low cost.\n\n\n# Quick Start\n\nThis quick start guide tries to demonstrate\n1. It''s very easy to build a complete Quant research workflow and try your ideas with _Qlib_.\n2. Though with *public data* and *simple models*, machine learning technologies **work very well** in practical Quant investment.\n\nHere is a quick **[demo](https://terminalizer.com/view/3f24561a4470)** shows how to install ``Qlib``, and run LightGBM with ``qrun``. **But**, please make sure you have already prepared the data following the [instruction](#data-preparation).\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThis table demonstrates the supported Python version of `Qlib`:\n|               | install with pip      | install from source  |        plot        |\n| ------------- |:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|\n| Python 3.8    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Python 3.9    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Python 3.10   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Python 3.11   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Python 3.12   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |\n\n**Note**: \n1. **Conda** is suggested for managing your Python environment. In some cases, using Python outside of a `conda` environment may result in missing header files, causing the installation failure of certain packages.\n2. Please pay attention that installing cython in Python 3.6 will raise some error when installing ``Qlib`` from source. If users use Python 3.6 on their machines, it is recommended to *upgrade* Python to version 3.8 or higher, or use `conda`''s Python to install ``Qlib`` from source.\n\n### Install with pip\nUsers can easily install ``Qlib`` by pip according to the following command.\n\n```bash\n  pip install pyqlib\n```\n\n**Note**: pip will install the latest stable qlib. However, the main branch of qlib is in active development. If you want to test the latest scripts or functions in the main branch. Please install qlib with the methods below.\n\n### Install from source\nAlso, users can install the latest dev version ``Qlib`` by the source code according to the following steps:\n\n* Before installing ``Qlib`` from source, users need to install some dependencies:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install numpy\n  pip install --upgrade cython\n  ```\n\n* Clone the repository and install ``Qlib`` as follows.\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib.git && cd qlib\n    pip install .  # `pip install -e .[dev]` is recommended for development. check details in docs/developer/code_standard_and_dev_guide.rst\n    ```\n\n**Tips**: If you fail to install `Qlib` or run the examples in your environment,  comparing your steps and the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/test_qlib_from_source.yml) may help you find the problem.\n\n**Tips for Mac**: If you are using Mac with M1, you might encounter issues in building the wheel for LightGBM, which is due to missing dependencies from OpenMP. To solve the problem, install openmp first with ``brew install libomp`` and then run ``pip install .`` to build it successfully. \n\n## Data Preparation\n❗ Due to more restrict data security policy. The official dataset is disabled temporarily. You can try [this data source](https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases) contributed by the community.\nHere is an example to download the latest data.\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases/latest/download/qlib_bin.tar.gz\nmkdir -p ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data\ntar -zxvf qlib_bin.tar.gz -C ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --strip-components=1\nrm -f qlib_bin.tar.gz\n```\n\nThe official dataset below will resume in short future.\n\n\n----\n\nLoad and prepare data by running the following code:\n\n### Get with module\n  ```bash\n  # get 1d data\n  python -m qlib.cli.data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn\n\n  # get 1min data\n  python -m qlib.cli.data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min\n\n  ```\n\n### Get from source\n\n  ```bash\n  # get 1d data\n  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn\n\n  # get 1min data\n  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min\n\n  ```\n\nThis dataset is created by public data collected by [crawler scripts](scripts/data_collector/), which have been released in\nthe same repository.\nUsers could create the same dataset with it. [Description of dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector#description-of-dataset)\n\n*Please pay **ATTENTION** that the data is collected from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup), and the data might not be perfect.\nWe recommend users to prepare their own data if they have a high-quality dataset. For more information, users can refer to the [related document](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html#converting-csv-format-into-qlib-format)*.\n\n### Automatic update of daily frequency data (from yahoo finance)\n  > This step is *Optional* if users only want to try their models and strategies on history data.\n  > \n  > It is recommended that users update the data manually once (--trading_date 2021-05-25) and then set it to update automatically.\n  >\n  > **NOTE**: Users can''t incrementally  update data based on the offline data provided by Qlib(some fields are removed to reduce the data size). Users should use [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance) to download Yahoo data from scratch and then incrementally update it.\n  > \n  > For more information, please refer to: [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance)\n\n  * Automatic update of data to the "qlib" directory each trading day(Linux)\n      * use *crontab*: `crontab -e`\n      * set up timed tasks:\n\n        ```\n        * * * * 1-5 python <script path> update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir <user data dir>\n        ```\n        * **script path**: *scripts/data_collector/yahoo/collector.py*\n\n  * Manual update of data\n      ```\n      python scripts/data_collector/yahoo/collector.py update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir <user data dir> --trading_date <start date> --end_date <end date>\n      ```\n      * *trading_date*: start of trading day\n      * *end_date*: end of trading day(not included)\n\n### Checking the health of the data\n  * We provide a script to check the health of the data, you can run the following commands to check whether the data is healthy or not.\n    ```\n    python scripts/check_data_health.py check_data --qlib_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data\n    ```\n  * Of course, you can also add some parameters to adjust the test results, such as this.\n    ```\n    python scripts/check_data_health.py check_data --qlib_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --missing_data_num 30055 --large_step_threshold_volume 94485 --large_step_threshold_price 20\n    ```\n  * If you want more information about `check_data_health`, please refer to the [documentation](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html#checking-the-health-of-the-data).\n\n<!-- \n- Run the initialization code and get stock data:\n\n  ```python\n  import qlib\n  from qlib.data import D\n  from qlib.constant import REG_CN\n\n  # Initialization\n  mount_path = "~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data"  # target_dir\n  qlib.init(mount_path=mount_path, region=REG_CN)\n\n  # Get stock data by Qlib\n  # Load trading calendar with the given time range and frequency\n  print(D.calendar(start_time=''2010-01-01'', end_time=''2017-12-31'', freq=''day'')[:2])\n\n  # Parse a given market name into a stockpool config\n  instruments = D.instruments(''csi500'')\n  print(D.list_instruments(instruments=instruments, start_time=''2010-01-01'', end_time=''2017-12-31'', as_list=True)[:6])\n\n  # Load features of certain instruments in given time range\n  instruments = [''SH600000'']\n  fields = [''$close'', ''$volume'', ''Ref($close, 1)'', ''Mean($close, 3)'', ''$high-$low'']\n  print(D.features(instruments, fields, start_time=''2010-01-01'', end_time=''2017-12-31'', freq=''day'').head())\n  ```\n -->\n\n## Docker images\n1.

To support a flexible Quant research workflow, Qlib also provides a modularized interface to allow researchers to build their own workflow by code. [Here](examples/workflow_by_code.ipynb) is a demo for customized Quant research workflow by code.\n\n# Main Challenges & Solutions in Quant Research\nQuant investment is a very unique scenario with lots of key challenges to be solved.\nCurrently, Qlib provides some solutions for several of them.\n\n## Forecasting: Finding Valuable Signals/Patterns\nAccurate forecasting of the stock price trend is a very important part to construct profitable portfolios.\nHowever, huge amount of data with various formats in the financial market which make it challenging to build forecasting models.\n\nAn increasing number of SOTA Quant research works/papers, which focus on building forecasting models to mine valuable signals/patterns in complex financial data, are released in `Qlib`\n\n\n### [Quant Model (Paper) Zoo](examples/benchmarks)\n\nHere is a list of models built on `Qlib`.\n- [GBDT based on XGBoost (Tianqi Chen, et al.

NeurIPS 2017)](examples/benchmarks/Transformer/)\n- [Localformer based on pytorch (Juyong Jiang, et al.)](examples/benchmarks/Localformer/)\n- [TRA based on pytorch (Hengxu, Dong, et al.

Users can find the config files we provide and some details about the model through the [benchmarks](examples/benchmarks) folder. More information can be retrieved at the model files listed above.\n\n`Qlib` provides three different ways to run a single model, users can pick the one that fits their cases best:\n- Users can use the tool `qrun` mentioned above to run a model''s workflow based from a config file.\n- Users can create a `workflow_by_code` python script based on the [one](examples/workflow_by_code.py) listed in the `examples` folder.\n\n- Users can use the script [`run_all_model.py`](examples/run_all_model.py) listed in the `examples` folder to run a model. Here is an example of the specific shell command to be used: `python run_all_model.py run --models=lightgbm`, where the `--models` arguments can take any number of models listed above(the available models can be found  in [benchmarks](examples/benchmarks/)). For more use cases, please refer to the file''s [docstrings](examples/run_all_model.py).\n    - **NOTE**: Each baseline has different environment dependencies, please make sure that your python version aligns with the requirements(e.g. TFT only supports Python 3.6~3.7 due to the limitation of `tensorflow==1.15.0`)\n\n### Run multiple models\n`Qlib` also provides a script [`run_all_model.py`](examples/run_all_model.py) which can run multiple models for several iterations. (**Note**: the script only support *Linux* for now. Other OS will be supported in the future. Besides, it doesn''t support parallel running the same model for multiple times as well, and this will be fixed in the future development too.)\n\nThe script will create a unique virtual environment for each model, and delete the environments after training. Thus, only experiment results such as `IC` and `backtest` results will be generated and stored.\n\nHere is an example of running all the models for 10 iterations:\n```python\npython run_all_model.py run 10\n```\n\nIt also provides the API to run specific models at once. For more use cases, please refer to the file''s [docstrings](examples/run_all_model.py). \n\n### Break change\nIn `pandas`, `group_key` is one of the parameters of the `groupby` method. From version 1.5 to 2.0 of `pandas`, the default value of `group_key` has been changed from `no default` to `True`, which will cause qlib to report an error during operation. So we set `group_key=False`, but it doesn''t guarantee that some programmes will run correctly, including:\n* qlib\examples\rl_order_execution\scripts\gen_training_orders.py\n* qlib\examples\benchmarks\TRA\src\dataset.MTSDatasetH.py\n* qlib\examples\benchmarks\TFT\tft.py\n\n\n\n## [Adapting to Market Dynamics](examples/benchmarks_dynamic)\n\nDue to the non-stationary nature of the environment of the financial market, the data distribution may change in different periods, which makes the performance of models build on training data decays in the future test data.\nSo adapting the forecasting models/strategies to market dynamics is very important to the model/strategies'' performance.\n\nHere is a list of solutions built on `Qlib`.\n- [Rolling Retraining](examples/benchmarks_dynamic/baseline/)\n- [DDG-DA on pytorch (Wendi, et al. AAAI 2022)](examples/benchmarks_dynamic/DDG-DA/)\n\n##  Reinforcement Learning: modeling continuous decisions\nQlib now supports reinforcement learning, a feature designed to model continuous investment decisions. This functionality assists investors in optimizing their trading strategies by learning from interactions with the environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\n\nHere is a list of solutions built on `Qlib` categorized by scenarios.\n\n### [RL for order execution](examples/rl_order_execution)\n[Here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl/overall.html#order-execution) is the introduction of this scenario.  All the methods below are compared [here](examples/rl_order_execution).\n- [TWAP](examples/rl_order_execution/exp_configs/backtest_twap.yml)\n- [PPO: "An End-to-End Optimal Trade Execution Framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization", IJCAL 2020](examples/rl_order_execution/exp_configs/backtest_ppo.yml)\n- [OPDS: "Universal Trading for Order Execution with Oracle Policy Distillation", AAAI 2021](examples/rl_order_execution/exp_configs/backtest_opds.yml)\n\n# Quant Dataset Zoo\nDataset plays a very important role in Quant. Here is a list of the datasets built on `Qlib`:\n\n| Dataset                                    | US Market | China Market |\n| --                                         | --        | --           |\n| [Alpha360](./qlib/contrib/data/handler.py) |  √        |  √           |\n| [Alpha158](./qlib/contrib/data/handler.py) |  √        |  √           |\n\n[Here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/alpha.html) is a tutorial to build dataset with `Qlib`.\nYour PR to build new Quant dataset is highly welcomed.\n\n\n# Learning Framework\nQlib is high customizable and a lot of its components are learnable.\nThe learnable components are instances of `Forecast Model` and `Trading Agent`. They are learned based on the `Learning Framework` layer and then applied to multiple scenarios in `Workflow` layer.\nThe learning framework leverages the `Workflow` layer as well(e.g. sharing `Information Extractor`, creating environments based on `Execution Env`).\n\nBased on learning paradigms, they can be categorized into reinforcement learning and supervised learning.\n- For supervised learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/model.html).\n- For reinforcement learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html). Qlib''s RL learning framework leverages `Execution Env` in `Workflow` layer to create environments.  It''s worth noting that `NestedExecutor` is supported as well. This empowers users to optimize different level of strategies/models/agents together (e.g. optimizing an order execution strategy for a specific portfolio management strategy).\n\n\n# More About Qlib\nIf you want to have a quick glance at the most frequently used components of qlib, you can try notebooks [here](examples/tutorial/).\n\nThe detailed documents are organized in [docs](docs/).\n[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the readthedocs theme is required to build the documentation in html formats. \n```bash\ncd docs/\nconda install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme -y\n# Otherwise, you can install them with pip\n# pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme\nmake html\n```\nYou can also view the [latest document](http://qlib.readthedocs.io/) online directly.\n\nQlib is in active and continuing development. Our plan is in the roadmap, which is managed as a [github project](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/projects/1).\n\n\n\n# Offline Mode and Online Mode\nThe data server of Qlib can either deployed as `Offline` mode or `Online` mode. The default mode is offline mode.\n\nUnder `Offline` mode, the data will be deployed locally. \n\nUnder `Online` mode, the data will be deployed as a shared data service. The data and their cache will be shared by all the clients. The data retrieval performance is expected to be improved due to a higher rate of cache hits. It will consume less disk space, too. The documents of the online mode can be found in [Qlib-Server](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/). The online mode can be deployed automatically with [Azure CLI based scripts](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#one-click-deployment-in-azure). The source code of online data server can be found in [Qlib-Server repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib-server).\n\n## Performance of Qlib Data Server\nThe performance of data processing is important to data-driven methods like AI technologies. As an AI-oriented platform, Qlib provides a solution for data storage and data processing. To demonstrate the performance of Qlib data server, we\ncompare it with several other data storage solutions. \n\nWe evaluate the performance of several storage solutions by finishing the same task,\nwhich creates a dataset (14 features/factors) from the basic OHLCV daily data of a stock market (800 stocks each day from 2007 to 2020). The task involves data queries and processing.\n\n|                         | HDF5      | MySQL     | MongoDB   | InfluxDB  | Qlib -E -D  | Qlib +E -D   | Qlib +E +D  |\n| --                      | ------    | ------    | --------  | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |\n| Total (1CPU) (seconds)  | 184.4±3.7 | 365.3±7.5 | 253.6±6.7 | 368.2±3.6 | 147.0±8.8   | 47.6±1.0     | **7.4±0.3** |\n| Total (64CPU) (seconds) |           |           |           |           | 8.8±0.6     | **4.2±0.2**  |             |\n* `+(-)E` indicates with (out) `ExpressionCache`\n* `+(-)D` indicates with (out) `DatasetCache`\n\nMost general-purpose databases take too much time to load data. After looking into the underlying implementation, we find that data go through too many layers of interfaces and unnecessary format transformations in general-purpose database solutions.\nSuch overheads greatly slow down the data loading process.\nQlib data are stored in a compact format, which is efficient to be combined into arrays for scientific computation.\n\n# Related Reports\n- [Guide To Qlib: Microsoft’s AI Investment Platform](https://analyticsindiamag.com/qlib/)\n- [微软也搞AI量化平台？还是开源的！](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/47bP5YwxfTp2uTHjUBzJQQ)\n- [微矿Qlib：业内首个AI量化投资开源平台](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vsJv7lsgjEi-ALYUz4CvtQ)\n\n# Contact Us\n- If you have any issues, please create issue [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/issues/new/choose) or send messages in [gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/qlib).\n- If you want to make contributions to `Qlib`, please [create pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/compare). \n- For other reasons, you are welcome to contact us by email([qlib@microsoft.com](mailto:qlib@microsoft.com)).\n  - We are recruiting new members(both FTEs and interns), your resumes are welcome!\n\nJoin IM discussion groups:\n|[Gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/qlib)|\n|----|\n|![image](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/qrcode/gitter_qr.png)|\n\n# Contributing\nWe appreciate all contributions and thank all the contributors!\n<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/graphs/contributors"><img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=microsoft/qlib" /></a>\n\nBefore we released Qlib as an open-source project on Github in Sep 2020, Qlib is an internal project in our group.

The OpenPose runtime is constant, while the runtime of Alpha-Pose and Mask R-CNN grow linearly with the number of people. More details [**here**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08008).\n\n<p align="center">\n    <img src=".github/media/openpose_vs_competition.png" width="360">\n</p>\n\n\n\n## Features\n**Main Functionality**:\n- **2D real-time multi-person keypoint detection**:\n    - 15, 18 or **25-keypoint body/foot keypoint estimation**, including **6 foot keypoints**. **Runtime invariant to number of detected people**.\n    - **2x21-keypoint hand keypoint estimation**. **Runtime depends on number of detected people**. See [**OpenPose Training**](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train) for a runtime invariant alternative.\n    - **70-keypoint face keypoint estimation**. **Runtime depends on number of detected people**. See [**OpenPose Training**](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train) for a runtime invariant alternative.\n- [**3D real-time single-person keypoint detection**](doc/advanced/3d_reconstruction_module.md):\n    - 3D triangulation from multiple single views.\n    - Synchronization of Flir cameras handled.\n    - Compatible with Flir/Point Grey cameras.\n- [**Calibration toolbox**](doc/advanced/calibration_module.md): Estimation of distortion, intrinsic, and extrinsic camera parameters.\n- **Single-person tracking** for further speedup or visual smoothing.\n\n**Input**: Image, video, webcam, Flir/Point Grey, IP camera, and support to add your own custom input source (e.g., depth camera).\n\n**Output**: Basic image + keypoint display/saving (PNG, JPG, AVI, ...), keypoint saving (JSON, XML, YML, ...), keypoints as array class, and support to add your own custom output code (e.g., some fancy UI).\n\n**OS**: Ubuntu (20, 18, 16, 14), Windows (10, 8), Mac OSX, Nvidia TX2.\n\n**Hardware compatibility**: CUDA (Nvidia GPU), OpenCL (AMD GPU), and non-GPU (CPU-only) versions.\n\n**Usage Alternatives**:\n- [**Command-line demo**](doc/01_demo.md) for built-in functionality.\n- [**C++ API**](doc/04_cpp_api.md/) and [**Python API**](doc/03_python_api.md) for custom functionality. E.g., adding your custom inputs, pre-processing, post-posprocessing, and output steps.\n\nFor further details, check the [major released features](doc/07_major_released_features.md) and [release notes](doc/08_release_notes.md) docs.\n\n\n\n## Related Work\n- [**OpenPose training code**](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train)\n- [**OpenPose foot dataset**](https://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/foot_keypoint_dataset/)\n- [**OpenPose Unity Plugin**](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_unity_plugin)\n- OpenPose papers published in **IEEE TPAMI and CVPR**. Cite them in your publications if OpenPose helps your research! (Links and more details in the [Citation](#citation) section below).\n\n\n\n## Installation\nIf you want to use OpenPose without installing or writing any code, simply [download and use the latest Windows portable version of OpenPose](doc/installation/0_index.md#windows-portable-demo)!\n\nOtherwise, you could [build OpenPose from source](doc/installation/0_index.md#compiling-and-running-openpose-from-source). See the [installation doc](doc/installation/0_index.md) for all the alternatives.\n\n\n\n## Quick Start Overview\nSimply use the OpenPose Demo from your favorite command-line tool (e.g., Windows PowerShell or Ubuntu Terminal). E.g., this example runs OpenPose on your webcam and displays the body keypoints:\n```\n# Ubuntu\n./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin\n```\n```\n:: Windows - Portable Demo\nbin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\media\video.avi\n```\n\nYou can also add any of the available flags in any order. E.g., the following example runs on a video (`--video {PATH}`), enables face (`--face`) and hands (`--hand`), and saves the output keypoints on JSON files on disk (`--write_json {PATH}`).\n```\n# Ubuntu\n./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --face --hand --write_json output_json_folder/\n```\n```\n:: Windows - Portable Demo\nbin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\media\video.avi --face --hand --write_json output_json_folder/\n```\n\nOptionally, you can also extend OpenPose''s functionality from its Python and C++ APIs. After [installing](doc/installation/0_index.md) OpenPose, check its [official doc](doc/00_index.md) for a quick overview of all the alternatives and tutorials.\n\n\n\n## Send Us Feedback!\nOur library is open source for research purposes, and we want to improve it! So let us know (create a new GitHub issue or pull request, email us, etc.) if you...\n1. Find/fix any bug (in functionality or speed) or know how to speed up or improve any part of OpenPose.\n2. Want to add/show some cool functionality/demo/project made on top of OpenPose. We can add your project link to our [Community-based Projects](doc/10_community_projects.md) section or even integrate it with OpenPose!\n\n\n\n## Citation\nPlease cite these papers in your publications if OpenPose helps your research. All of OpenPose is based on [OpenPose: Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affinity Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08008), while the hand and face detectors also use [Hand Keypoint Detection in Single Images using Multiview Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07809) (the face detector was trained using the same procedure as the hand detector).\n\n    @article{8765346,\n      author = {Z. {Cao} and G. {Hidalgo Martinez} and T. {Simon} and S. {Wei} and Y.

These algorithms span a variety of topics from computer science, mathematics and statistics, data science, machine learning, engineering, etc.. The implementations and the associated documentation are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using a different algorithm strategies and optimizations.\n\n## Features\n\n- The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages - [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).\n- Well documented source code with detailed explanations provide a valuable resource for educators and students alike.\n- Each source code is atomic using [STL classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) and _no external libraries_ are required for their compilation and execution. Thus, the fundamentals of the algorithms can be studied in much depth.\n- Source codes are [compiled and tested](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Awesome+CI+Workflow%22) for every commit on the latest versions of three major operating systems viz., Windows, MacOS, and Ubuntu (Linux) using MSVC 19 2022, AppleClang 15.0.15, and GNU 13.3.0 respectively.\n- Strict adherence to [C++17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17) standard ensures portability of code to embedded systems as well like [ESP32](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/cplusplus.html#c-language-standard), [ARM Cortex](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101458/2404/Standards-support/Supported-C-C---standards-in-Arm-C-C---Compiler), etc. with little to no changes.\n- Self-checks within programs ensure correct implementations with confidence.\n- Modular implementations and OpenSource licensing enable the functions to be utilized conveniently in other applications.\n\n## Documentation\n\n[Online Documentation](https://TheAlgorithms.github.io/C-Plus-Plus) is generated from the repository source codes directly. The documentation contains all resources including source code snippets, details on execution of the programs, diagrammatic representation of program flow, and links to external resources where necessary. The documentation also introduces interactive source code with links to documentation for C++ STL library functions used.\nClick on [Files menu](https://TheAlgorithms.github.io/C-Plus-Plus/files.html) to see the list of all the files documented with the code.\n\n[Documentation of Algorithms in C++](https://thealgorithms.github.io/C-Plus-Plus) by [The Algorithms Contributors](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus/graphs/contributors) is licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1)<br/>\n<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="height:22px!important;margin-left: 3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg" /><img  alt="Credit must be given to the creator" style="height:22px!important;margin-left: 3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg" /><img alt="Adaptations must be shared under the same terms" style="height:22px!important;margin-left: 3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/sa.svg" /></a>\n\n## Contributions\n\nAs a community developed and maintained repository, we welcome new un-plagiarized quality contributions.

The lookups package is needed to create blank models with\nlemmatization data, and to lemmatize in languages that don''t yet come with\npretrained models and aren''t powered by third-party libraries.\n\nWhen using pip it is generally recommended to install packages in a virtual\nenvironment to avoid modifying system state:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv .env\nsource .env/bin/activate\npip install -U pip setuptools wheel\npip install spacy\n```\n\n### conda\n\nYou can also install spaCy from `conda` via the `conda-forge` channel. For the\nfeedstock including the build recipe and configuration, check out\n[this repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/spacy-feedstock).\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge spacy\n```\n\n### Updating spaCy\n\nSome updates to spaCy may require downloading new statistical models. If you''re\nrunning spaCy v2.0 or higher, you can use the `validate` command to check if\nyour installed models are compatible and if not, print details on how to update\nthem:\n\n```bash\npip install -U spacy\npython -m spacy validate\n```\n\nIf you''ve trained your own models, keep in mind that your training and runtime\ninputs must match. After updating spaCy, we recommend **retraining your models**\nwith the new version.\n\n📖 **For details on upgrading from spaCy 2.x to spaCy 3.x, see the\n[migration guide](https://spacy.io/usage/v3#migrating).**\n\n## 📦 Download model packages\n\nTrained pipelines for spaCy can be installed as **Python packages**. This means\nthat they''re a component of your application, just like any other module. Models\ncan be installed using spaCy''s [`download`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#download)\ncommand, or manually by pointing pip to a path or URL.\n\n| Documentation              |                                                                  |\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **[Available Pipelines]**  | Detailed pipeline descriptions, accuracy figures and benchmarks. |\n| **[Models Documentation]** | Detailed usage and installation instructions.                    |\n| **[Training]**             | How to train your own pipelines on your data.                    |\n\n[available pipelines]: https://spacy.io/models\n[models documentation]: https://spacy.io/usage/models\n[training]: https://spacy.io/usage/training\n\n```bash\n# Download best-matching version of specific model for your spaCy installation\npython -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n\n# pip install .tar.gz archive or .whl from path or URL\npip install /Users/you/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0.tar.gz\npip install /Users/you/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0-py3-none-any.whl\npip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n### Loading and using models\n\nTo load a model, use [`spacy.load()`](https://spacy.io/api/top-level#spacy.load)\nwith the model name or a path to the model data directory.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nnlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")\ndoc = nlp("This is a sentence.")\n```\n\nYou can also `import` a model directly via its full name and then call its\n`load()` method with no arguments.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nimport en_core_web_sm\n\nnlp = en_core_web_sm.load()\ndoc = nlp("This is a sentence.")\n```\n\n📖 **For more info and examples, check out the\n[models documentation](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/models).**\n\n## ⚒ Compile from source\n\nThe other way to install spaCy is to clone its\n[GitHub repository](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) and build it from\nsource. That is the common way if you want to make changes to the code base.\nYou''ll need to make sure that you have a development environment consisting of a\nPython distribution including header files, a compiler,\n[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/),\n[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and\n[git](https://git-scm.com) installed. The compiler part is the trickiest. How to\ndo that depends on your system.\n\n| Platform    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Ubuntu**  | Install system-level dependencies via `apt-get`: `sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev git` .                                                                                                                                                            |\n| **Mac**     | Install a recent version of [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), including the so-called "Command Line Tools". macOS and OS X ship with Python and git preinstalled.                                                                                        |\n| **Windows** | Install a version of the [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) or [Visual Studio Express](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/express/) that matches the version that was used to compile your Python interpreter. |\n\nFor more details and instructions, see the documentation on\n[compiling spaCy from source](https://spacy.io/usage#source) and the\n[quickstart widget](https://spacy.io/usage#section-quickstart) to get the right\ncommands for your platform and Python version.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/explosion/spaCy\ncd spaCy\n\npython -m venv .env\nsource .env/bin/activate\n\n# make sure you are using the latest pip\npython -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install --no-build-isolation --editable .\n```\n\nTo install with extras:\n\n```bash\npip install --no-build-isolation --editable .[lookups,cuda102]\n```\n\n## 🚦 Run tests\n\nspaCy comes with an [extensive test suite](spacy/tests).

It can be instructed in natural language to predict the most relevant text snippet, given an image, without directly optimizing for the task, similarly to the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-2 and 3. We found CLIP matches the performance of the original ResNet50 on ImageNet “zero-shot” without using any of the original 1.28M labeled examples, overcoming several major challenges in computer vision.\n\n\n\n## Approach\n\n![CLIP](CLIP.png)\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, [install PyTorch 1.7.1](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (or later) and torchvision, as well as small additional dependencies, and then install this repo as a Python package. On a CUDA GPU machine, the following will do the trick:\n\n```bash\n$ conda install --yes -c pytorch pytorch=1.7.1 torchvision cudatoolkit=11.0\n$ pip install ftfy regex tqdm\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git\n```\n\nReplace `cudatoolkit=11.0` above with the appropriate CUDA version on your machine or `cpuonly` when installing on a machine without a GPU.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport clip\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndevice = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"\nmodel, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32", device=device)\n\nimage = preprocess(Image.open("CLIP.png")).unsqueeze(0).to(device)\ntext = clip.tokenize(["a diagram", "a dog", "a cat"]).to(device)\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    image_features = model.encode_image(image)\n    text_features = model.encode_text(text)\n    \n    logits_per_image, logits_per_text = model(image, text)\n    probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=-1).cpu().numpy()\n\nprint("Label probs:", probs)  # prints: [[0.9927937  0.00421068 0.00299572]]\n```\n\n\n## API\n\nThe CLIP module `clip` provides the following methods:\n\n#### `clip.available_models()`\n\nReturns the names of the available CLIP models.\n\n#### `clip.load(name, device=..., jit=False)`\n\nReturns the model and the TorchVision transform needed by the model, specified by the model name returned by `clip.available_models()`. It will download the model as necessary. The `name` argument can also be a path to a local checkpoint.\n\nThe device to run the model can be optionally specified, and the default is to use the first CUDA device if there is any, otherwise the CPU. When `jit` is `False`, a non-JIT version of the model will be loaded.\n\n#### `clip.tokenize(text: Union[str, List[str]], context_length=77)`\n\nReturns a LongTensor containing tokenized sequences of given text input(s). This can be used as the input to the model\n\n---\n\nThe model returned by `clip.load()` supports the following methods:\n\n#### `model.encode_image(image: Tensor)`\n\nGiven a batch of images, returns the image features encoded by the vision portion of the CLIP model.\n\n#### `model.encode_text(text: Tensor)`\n\nGiven a batch of text tokens, returns the text features encoded by the language portion of the CLIP model.\n\n#### `model(image: Tensor, text: Tensor)`\n\nGiven a batch of images and a batch of text tokens, returns two Tensors, containing the logit scores corresponding to each image and text input. The values are cosine similarities between the corresponding image and text features, times 100.\n\n\n\n## More Examples\n\n### Zero-Shot Prediction\n\nThe code below performs zero-shot prediction using CLIP, as shown in Appendix B in the paper. This example takes an image from the [CIFAR-100 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), and predicts the most likely labels among the 100 textual labels from the dataset.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport clip\nimport torch\nfrom torchvision.datasets import CIFAR100\n\n# Load the model\ndevice = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"\nmodel, preprocess = clip.load(''ViT-B/32'', device)\n\n# Download the dataset\ncifar100 = CIFAR100(root=os.path.expanduser("~/.cache"), download=True, train=False)\n\n# Prepare the inputs\nimage, class_id = cifar100[3637]\nimage_input = preprocess(image).unsqueeze(0).to(device)\ntext_inputs = torch.cat([clip.tokenize(f"a photo of a {c}") for c in cifar100.classes]).to(device)\n\n# Calculate features\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    image_features = model.encode_image(image_input)\n    text_features = model.encode_text(text_inputs)\n\n# Pick the top 5 most similar labels for the image\nimage_features /= image_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\ntext_features /= text_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\nsimilarity = (100.0 * image_features @ text_features.T).softmax(dim=-1)\nvalues, indices = similarity[0].topk(5)\n\n# Print the result\nprint("\nTop predictions:\n")\nfor value, index in zip(values, indices):\n    print(f"{cifar100.classes[index]:>16s}: {100 * value.item():.2f}%")\n```\n\nThe output will look like the following (the exact numbers may be slightly different depending on the compute device):\n\n```\nTop predictions:\n\n           snake: 65.31%\n          turtle: 12.29%\n    sweet_pepper: 3.83%\n          lizard: 1.88%\n       crocodile: 1.75%\n```\n\nNote that this example uses the `encode_image()` and `encode_text()` methods that return the encoded features of given inputs.\n\n\n### Linear-probe evaluation\n\nThe example below uses [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) to perform logistic regression on image features.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport clip\nimport torch\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision.datasets import CIFAR100\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\n# Load the model\ndevice = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"\nmodel, preprocess = clip.load(''ViT-B/32'', device)\n\n# Load the dataset\nroot = os.path.expanduser("~/.cache")\ntrain = CIFAR100(root, download=True, train=True, transform=preprocess)\ntest = CIFAR100(root, download=True, train=False, transform=preprocess)\n\n\ndef get_features(dataset):\n    all_features = []\n    all_labels = []\n    \n    with torch.no_grad():\n        for images, labels in tqdm(DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=100)):\n            features = model.encode_image(images.to(device))\n\n            all_features.append(features)\n            all_labels.append(labels)\n\n    return torch.cat(all_features).cpu().numpy(), torch.cat(all_labels).cpu().numpy()\n\n# Calculate the image features\ntrain_features, train_labels = get_features(train)\ntest_features, test_labels = get_features(test)\n\n# Perform logistic regression\nclassifier = LogisticRegression(random_state=0, C=0.316, max_iter=1000, verbose=1)\nclassifier.fit(train_features, train_labels)\n\n# Evaluate using the logistic regression classifier\npredictions = classifier.predict(test_features)\naccuracy = np.mean((test_labels == predictions).astype(float)) * 100.\nprint(f"Accuracy = {accuracy:.3f}")\n```\n\nNote that the `C` value should be determined via a hyperparameter sweep using a validation split.\n\n\n## See Also\n\n* [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip): includes larger and independently trained CLIP models up to ViT-G/14\n* [Hugging Face implementation of CLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/clip): for easier integration with the HF ecosystem\n', '{"language":"Jupyter Notebook","stars":31883,"forks":3858,"watchers":31883,"open_issues":265,"topics":["deep-learning","machine-learning"],"default_branch":"main","size_kb":9140,"archived":false,"fork":false,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false}', '[]', '[{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:openai:CLIP.git","source_url":"https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git"},{"type":"has_code","target_id":"github:mlfoundations:open_clip","source_url":"https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip"}]', NULL, 'MIT', 'approved', 65, '4a11535c9dd86fc0584b456ad8f4118a', NULL, NULL, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

A candidate is selected as a parent with probabilities proportional\n    to the candidate''s fitness. Reproduction is implemented as a single-point\n    crossover between pairs of parents. Mutation is done by randomly assigning\n    new characters with uniform probability.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    Target String: ''Genetic Algorithm''\n    Population Size: 100\n    Mutation
